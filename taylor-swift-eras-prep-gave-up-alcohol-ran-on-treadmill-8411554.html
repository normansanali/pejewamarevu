  In a new interview with Time Magazine, in which Swift was named the publication’s 2023 Person of the Year, the songstress opened up about all of the preparation that went into building her stamina for the monstrous 180-minute show, which she says was “harder than anything I’d ever done before by a long shot."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs,” she said, noting that her gym also crafted her a workout plan. “Then, I had three months of dance training, because I wanted to get it in my bones. I wanted to be so over-rehearsed that I could be silly with the fans, and not lose my train of thought. Learning choreography is not my strong suit.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift also revealed that she gave up drinking while working on the tour — aside from a boozy and “hilarious” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>night at the 2023 Grammys</a>, because duh — adding, “Doing that show with a hangover … I don’t want to know that world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how she chooses to recover after a weekend full of shows? “I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,” she told the publication. “It’s a dream scenario. I can barely speak, because I’ve been singing for three shows straight. Every time I take a step, my feet go crunch, crunch, crunch from dancing in heels.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZJ6qkah6sb7EqWSgmaaaera8jJqjnKeYpLluvsCnZKimXam%2Fpq3DpqClpF1tgXJ9lG5r</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
