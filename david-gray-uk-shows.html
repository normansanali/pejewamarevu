He will be performing in Manchester, Gateshead, Bristol and two nights in London.</p><h4><span>Tour Dates</span></h4><p>11 December – Albert Hall, Manchetser<br>13 December – Cadogan Hall, London<br>14 December – Cadogan Hall, London<br>17 December – Sage, Gateshead<br>18 December – Colston Hall, Bristol</p><p>The tour will support David’s forthcoming compilation, The Best Of David Gray, which is due for release on October 2016. The album will contain the highlights from his previous releases including Draw The Line, Founding, Mutineers and the Grammy-nominated White Ladder. We can expect to hear some of David’s biggest hits, such as ‘Babylon’, ‘This Year’s Love’, and ‘Sail Away’, alongside two new tracks – ‘Smoke Without Fire’ and ‘Enter Lightly’.</p><p>Alongside a traditional CD, deluxe CD and vinyl release, David has also taken note of the power of streaming, by releasing an innovative Spotify playlist, entitled ‘Best of David Gray Weekly’. The playlist will replace the static snapshot of a traditional Greatest Hits Collection, as the adaptive tracklisting will actually change weekly to reflect the most streamed tracks from David’s catalogue.</p><p>The vinyl and deluxe CD format of The Best Of will also feature a collection of songs of David’s own choosing, including three new re-recordings.</p><p>Speaking about the process, David said: “It felt like the right thing to do to accompany the main collection with a group of tracks that has been selected by me for no other reason than that they occupy a special place in my heart and have meant a lot to me down the years. These recordings stand like markers in the road, and I still refer back to them every now and then, whenever I’m in need of taking my creative bearings.”</p><p>The Best of David Gray is set to be personal to both David and the listener, depending on which format you’ll be listening to. What’s certain is that David has delivered on a rare remit- a living, breathing collection every bit as dynamic and vital as the 25 year long career it spans.</p><p>Tickets for David’s tour go on sale on Friday (September 23) at 9am. The Best Of David Gray will follow on October 28.</p><p>What’s your favourite David Gray song?
