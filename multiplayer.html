However, one aspect in any game of this size that players want to know is whether you can play with your friends, i.e. a multiplayer system.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So to help anyone who asking this question before they buy the game, we will be discussing exactly that. Below you can find everything you need to know regarding whether Starfield will include a multiplayer system upon its release.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Does Starfield Have a Multiplayer System?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At its current status, Starfield is exclusively designed for a <a href=#>single-player experience</a>, and lacks any multiplayer functionalities, meaning that cooperative gameplay with friends is not an option. The essence of Starfield revolves around an individual player's journey through a single-player campaign, strongly emphasizing the creation of distinct narratives driven by player choices in the realm of role-playing (similar to Skyrim).</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/CXimE4RrW61nuW1iN_IXD7TSYRAIGIns2RdVrvyBMNo/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyZmllbGQvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXIvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXJOb3RBdEx1YW5jaC5qcGc><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a solo adventure, players are empowered to shape their character's identity, drawing from chosen backgrounds, traits, and other attributes. The freedom extends to forming alliances and selecting companions for the expedition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although multiplayer capabilities are absent, enthusiasts of the game might find excitement in the revelation that Starfield encompasses a roster of over 20 named crew members. And based on how humorous, dynamic, and driven NPCs in Bethesda's previous titles were (nobody mentions Nazeem), we won't be missing out too much on the multiplayer experience.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/ktqo2f0SgcEGynw9pBcmAJEOJdPfOAnBH910FdsfYQU/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyZmllbGQvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXIvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXJNYXlDb21lSW5GdXR1cmUuanBn><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, despite the single-player focus <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">at launch</a>, the potential for Starfield to introduce multiplayer functionality remains plausible. And as is the case with most other AAA titles, multiplayer mechanics might hinge on the game's performance, reception, and player outcry. Nevertheless, this notion rests purely on speculation, and whether Starfield will ever incorporate multiplayer mechanics remains undetermined.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Now, while there are benefits of cooperative gameplay, Starfield still permits players to traverse the <a href=#>boundless expanses of space</a> in the company of recruitable non-playable characters (NPCs), including a selection of characters open to romantic entanglements for players inclined towards romantic options in role-playing games.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/xImUFG5B3cWgNoydILysqHRf6RmjkWw4F7oN0TRDeR4/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyZmllbGQvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXIvU3RhcmZpZWxkV2lsbFRoZUdhbWVIYXZlTXVsdGlwbGF5ZXJTdGlsbFRvbnNUb0RvSW5TaW5nbGVQbGF5ZXIuanBn><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Players also have the opportunity to encounter inhabited planets and can elect to align themselves with one among the game's diverse factions, which encompass groups like Constellation, a faction of pioneering space explorers unraveling the universe's enigmas, as well as the Crimson Fleet, among others.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So there you have it. Starfield will sadly not include a multiplayer feature at launch. However, the game still offers tons of content that all focuses on making the single-player experience as enjoyable as possible. If multiplayer is ever introduced into Starfield, you can expect us to cover it here promptly, so be sure to check back frequently for more.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/vul_22tVn4YjL9xJpLCkxwYYi3NfUZL5OGzxSphrJ78/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9zaGFuZS5qcGc alt="Shane Moosa" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Shane Moosa</a></h3><p>Shane started his career as a freelance writer for <a href=#>Gamezo</a> while working full-time as a software developer.
