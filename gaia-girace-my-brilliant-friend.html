Source: HBOOur favorite show, My Brilliant Friend, is finally back on our screens for Season 2, which is also called The Story of a New Name.
Aside from seeing Elena Ferrante's brilliant novels come to life against the backdrop of Naples in the '50s, it's also been incredibly enjoyable to see how modern-day Italian actors take on the roles of our beloved protagonists."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She tells Vogue that when she learned she was cast in the role, she wasn't clamoring to scream it from the rooftops, as one might imagine from a teen her age. "It's was a thing for me," Gaia, then 15, told the outlet. "A personal thing."</p><p>Given the fact that so much of the novels has to do with the relationship between Gaia's Lila and Margherita Mazzucco's Elena, what with their rivalries, competitiveness, support, and lifelong friendship at the forefront of the series, it was crucial to get the casting right — and My Brilliant Friend truly succeeded.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gaia Girace (@gaiaalwaysonfire)</a> on Mar 30, 2020 at 2:55pm PDT</p></figure><p>Since the actresses hadn't done much acting before, the audition doubled as an intensive acting workshop and a crash-course in the dialect.</p><p>"I fell in love with my character from the first scene I had to play, so I wanted to get that part at all costs," Gaia said of the lengthy audition process, which lasted seven months.</p><p>"I like the fact that she's observant and empathetic.
