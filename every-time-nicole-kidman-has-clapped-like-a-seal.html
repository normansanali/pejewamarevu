Like ‘Why isn’t Nicole clapping?’ So therefore I’m clapping but it was really difficult because I had a huge ring on that was not mine — but it was absolutely gorgeous — and I was terrified of damaging it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nicole-kidman-clapping-1.jpg><p>Kidman went a step further when she appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2017 and showed host <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong> that she <a href=#>knows how to clap normally</a>. “I don’t clap like that! I do not clap like that,” she told the comedian at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the Boy Erased actress was definitely embarrassed by her <a href=#>unique clapping demonstration</a>, the technique did its job. She added on the talk show, “[The jewels] went back beautifully intact, not a scratch on them.”</p><p>Watch the video above to revisit the hilarious examples of Kidman seal-clapping in the past!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvnaKuerW1zJ5kp6GTpLmmecqim6aZnmK1or%2BMnKOaqKCasW64yKScZpldqLKiuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
