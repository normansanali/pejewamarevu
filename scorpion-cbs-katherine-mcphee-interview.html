“I always liked things based in reality and the main character of our show is a real person, his name is Walter O’Brien,” the actress adds."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So people who watch the show can be interested in things that really do happen,” Katherine explains.</p><h3>Do Not Expect Katherine McPhee To Sing & Dance On ‘Scorpion’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>The former&nbsp;American Idol contestant previously starred on&nbsp;Smash, but even though she’s known for her killer pipes, don’t expect Katherine to sing. Her character, Paige Dineen, is much more serious than her usual casting, but she does stick out from the rest of the cast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“My character’s not a genius,” Katherine says. “I think it’s probably one of the first characters that I’ve had a little bit more of a difficult time relating to her just because I don’t have a kid and I’m not a single mother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although she’s the only non-genius, she finds an unusual bond with the geeks over her son.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“She has a little 8-year-old boy that’s challenged so she’s kind of working really hard to support him and to connect with him and she doesn’t really connect with him,” she tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>. “Walter O’Brien comes to the rescue and kind of informs me that my child is maybe not so much a special needs child, but maybe a real eccentric genius. So they all suddenly become this outlet to my son and connection to my son that I haven’t been able to have with him, until I could understand him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>And as for her own real-life talents, “I may not be dancing and singing on screen, but I’ll keep dancing and singing off camera!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you hooked on&nbsp;Scorpion?
