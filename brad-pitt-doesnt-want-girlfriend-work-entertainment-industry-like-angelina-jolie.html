But it appears the actor believes his relationship is successful in part because Ines isn’t in the entertainment industry, unlike Brad’s ex-wife <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>.</p><p>Ines, who was previously married to Vampire Diaries actor Paul Wesley, works in the jewelry industry. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As per PEOPLE</a>, she’s currently the head of wholesale for Anita Ko jewelry, an LA-based designer that’s created pieces for celebs like Kourtney Kardashian and Hailey Bieber.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/these-brad-pitt-movies-have-grossed-over.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Brad Pitt Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt is one of the most well-known leading men in Hollywood and has been for nearly three decades now.

They both share a love of art.”</p><p>“He appreciates that Ines isn’t in the industry,” they continued. “And she seems totally unfazed by his celebrity.”</p><p>“Ines has been a breath of fresh air for Brad. She’s smart and down-to-earth and supportive,” the source went on. “It’s been a crazy year for Brad, but Ines is the one great thing that’s happened to him. Having her in his life has made it less stressful for sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast, Brad’s past marriages have been extremely high profile, and it’s hard not to assume the publicity took a toll on the relationships. He was married to Jennifer Aniston from 2000 to 2005, but got into a relationship with Angelina before their divorce was even finalized. This created a perceived love triangle in the tabloids that still captures the public’s attention to this day.</p><h2 id=brad-and-ines-want-to-start-a-family-of-their-own>Brad And Ines Want To Start A Family Of Their Own</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ines-de-ramon-2023.jpg><p>Even though Brad’s romantic life may be largely out of the spotlight, his relationship with his six kids continues to be a big source of speculation.
