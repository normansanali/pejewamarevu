In November, Ric Flair said that he was tired of the negativity. He noted that he was willing to walk away from AEW if he embarrassed Tony Khan or the company. The post came after Flair drew criticism for inviting “18-28 year-old women [to] come to my hotel room, no boyfriends no husbands” at an AEW Rampage taping."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He noted that he was willing to walk away from AEW if he embarrassed Tony Khan or the company. The post came after Flair drew criticism for inviting “18-28 year-old women [to] come to my hotel room, no boyfriends no husbands” at an AEW Rampage taping.</p><p>Ric Flair appeared as a guest on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News on New Year’s Eve</a>. During the show, Tyrus told Flair that he had nothing to apologize for. (H/t Eric Mutter of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Inc.</a> for the transcription)</p><p>“I&nbsp;have to be honest with you, I have a little bit of beef with you,” Tyrus said. “You put a post out where you had the temerity to think that maybe you shouldn’t have walked out there at AEW. Let me remind you of who you are. You have forgotten more wrestling than most of us will ever know. You are one of the last greats that when you come out, and walk that aisle, a grandfather can look at his grandson and say ‘I saw this guy wrestle and this is the reason why you’re here.’</p><p>“Don’t you ever, and I don’t comment on social media that much, but don’t you ever apologize for Ric Flair coming out. Because when you come out, that pop is as loud as it’s ever been. I have to remind you of two things. Diamonds are forever and so is Ric Flair. You need to remember that. Thank you for who you are, sir. You are welcome at any wrestling arena at any time because you just walking by the locker room, we’re all going to get smarter.”</p><p>Ric Flair recently said he liked the way Vince McMahon ran WWE.
