That deadline has almost arrived, and some device owners are eligible for discounted upgrades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Google is ending support for the Dropcam, Dropcam Pro, and Nest Sure on April 8, 2024, after <a href=#>announcing the shutdown a year ago</a>. The Dropcam cameras will not work after that date: recorded video won’t be accessible, and they won’t be configurable through the Nest app. The Nest Secure home security system is also shutting down, and anyone using a Nest x Yale Lock will need to replace it with a Nest Connect for the lock to remain functional.</p><p>Google said in a support article, “About a year ago we announced that support for Dropcam, Dropcam Pro, and Nest Secure will end on April 8, 2024. Since then, we’ve reached out to impacted users through a series of email communications and in-app messages to help prepare for this transition, and to provide special offers based on eligibility.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dropcam was released in 2012 as a simple smart home security camera, and the Dropcam Pro arrived in 2013 as a follow-up with improved video and sound quality. Google <a href=#>bought the company behind both cameras</a> in 2014 to help boost its Nest smart home ecosystem, which at the time only offered smart thermostats and smoke detectors. Google later released its own Nest-branded cameras, but the early Dropcam models have remained functional until now.</p><p>The Nest Secure home security system is a sensor and keypad arming system, initially released in 2017. It was discontinued three years later with no direct replacement.</p><p>It’s not great that these older devices are becoming e-waste, but it’s not all bad news. Google is giving “eligible” Dropcam and Dropcam Pro owners a discount on the indoor wired Nest Cam, which can be redeemed until May 7, 2024. Since there was never a direct replacement for the Nest Secure, Google sent discounts for a Self Setup System from ADT to “eligible” Nest Secure owners, or $200 to use in the Google Store.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have one of the affected devices, check your inbox for discount offers from Google. If you have a Nest x Yale Lock paired to a Nest Guard, you’ll have to <a href=#>create a passcode</a> to continue using the keypad after April 7, 2024.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Google</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGieqKeXobJuusSsq2arlZjCs7GMnamoqJOWum6%2Fx66rnaeno3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
