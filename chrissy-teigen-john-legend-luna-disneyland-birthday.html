She also wore a pair of sparkly yellow sandals and her hair was in a topknot with the must-have accessory for every birthday toddler: a tiara. Along with her baby brother Miles, the family all posed with a cast of Disney princesses including Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog.</p><img alt="John Legend And Chrissy Teigen Visit Disneyland Resort" title="John Legend And Chrissy Teigen Visit Disneyland Resort" width=2700 height=1802 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-handout-image-john-legend-chrissy-teigen-their-news-photo-1136588468-1555349262.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Handout</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="John Legend And Chrissy Teigen Visit Disneyland Resort" title="John Legend And Chrissy Teigen Visit Disneyland Resort" width=2700 height=1802 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-handout-image-john-legend-chrissy-teigen-and-their-news-photo-1136588467-1555349275.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Handout</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Chrissy and John shared content from their family trip on their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When they arrived at "the happiest place on earth," Legend posted a sweet photograph of Luna on his shoulders and Teigen grinning hard in the background. "Luna had a Disneyland birthday today! (As far as she knows, her birthday is today. Don't tell her it's Sunday please. Daddy has to work on Sunday. Thank you.)," he captioned his Instagram post.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a second photograph, Legend posted a mild thirst trap with his friend and director-photographer Mike Rosenthal (husband of celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin). Luna sat on top of her father's shoulders, while Miles chilled on Rosenthal's shoulders. "@mrmikerosenthal and I are submitting this to @dilfs_of_disneyland," Legend captioned the 'gram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the time, the Disneyland DILF account did not acknowledge Legend's post, so he went ahead and posted a second thirst trap. "This is my last, desperate attempt. Your move, @dilfs_of_disneyland," Legend captioned the picture of him pushing Luna in a stroller.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following day, @dilfs_of_disneyland reposted not one, but both of John Legend's pictures to their feed. "John, how could we even make you wait this long... you are the definition of #strollermeat 🙌🏻 😍😍😍," they wrote in the first repost. The hot dads-focused account was so excited about the shoutout from Legend they wrote, "DOUBLE DILF spotting 😍😍😍" under the second regram.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Teigen posted a series of super cute photographs and videos to her Instagram from Lunda's birthday celebrations. "Happy birthday weekend, my loonie toons!!!," Teigen wrote under a video of Luna in a black and white swimsuit, sandals, and a pair of pink sunglasses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mother-daughter duo looked adorable as they sat on the edge of a hotel pool and splashed their feet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After they spent some quality time lounging by the pool, they joined Teigen's mother for a family tradition. "My thai princess heading to the temple today (in the same bun crown I wore!) for thai New Year and her birthday blessing! also to get me some shrimp paste and pork rinds," Teigen wrote underneath the darling 'gram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last March, Luna joined her parents for a trip to Disneyland Hong Kong, and she thoroughly enjoyed her international trip. When she saw Minnie Mouse, she quickly embraced the Disney character with a big hug. However, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a19390151/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-luna-disneyland/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chrissy wasn't feeling the shade from her daughter" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Chrissy wasn't feeling the shade from her daughter</a>. "She lets me hug her once a week," Teigen wrote under the heart-warming video.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miles turns one in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/996984651842437127?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=May class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">May</a>, so we're hoping that our invite to the next Legend family birthday party doesn't get lost in the mail.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d513768d-85e7-45bd-84c7-b5cb68908a8d_1667322961.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" title="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><a href=#>Nicole Saunders</a>is the beauty editor at Best Products with over seven years of experience researching, writing, and editing lifestyle content.
