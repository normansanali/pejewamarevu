The rapper appeared on Kai Cenat's stream earlier this week, where he freestyled over the famous track while the internet icon danced behind him.

Some critics weren't impressed, however, and are calling for the Memphis-born performer to leave the song alone. "I think we need to take a step back with music," one Twitter/X user says. Someone else adds, "This is so trash."

"Tyla never coming back on Kai Cenat stream after this NLE Choppa freestyle," one user writes. "Kai turning up to it like it’s the next best hit," another says. This is far from the first time NLE Choppa's explicit lyrics left fans in awe, however. Last month, he performed a new song for his audience at Rolling Loud, which garnered quite a few reactions for its <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">NSFW rhymes and his suggestive dance moves</a>. The track, "Slut Me Out 2," is scheduled for release at midnight (April 12).</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">His increasingly scandalous social media activity even recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">caught the attention of Adam22</a>, who complimented the MC for one of his thirst traps. He didn't seem interested in the No Jumper host, but did note that he'd be willing to get to know his wife, Lena The Plug. What do you think of NLE Choppa's "Water" freestyle?
