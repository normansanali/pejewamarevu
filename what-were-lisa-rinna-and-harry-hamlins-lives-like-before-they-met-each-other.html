They have found success as actors and seem to be more in love than ever. While it's hard to think about one without the other, they both had exciting lives before they met each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Kelly Ripa And Lisa Rinna's Friendship</a></span></p><p>It's interesting to see how their personalities have not changed, but evolved over the years and how their differences <a href=#>make their relationship better</a>. Lisa has always has a wild side and live a life full of excitement and adventure and Harry was focused on his education and building a career. While they both feel that they are better together, here's what their lives were like before they met each other.</p><h2 id=she-was-a-circus-performer><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Was A Circus Performer</span></h2><p>Lisa has a lot of talent and is a natural performer. Her good looks and tone body led to her <a href=#>performing in a circus in 1990</a> called&nbsp;Circus of the Stars.&nbsp;While preparing for her performance she learned to walk to tight rope. Had she not went on to star in a reality show, there's a good chance she could have been a traveling performer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-wanted-to-be-an-architect><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Wanted To Be An Architect</span></h2><p>Before studying to become an actor, Harry had planned to become an architect. He has an interest in design and history and planned to attend college at&nbsp;University of California – Berkeley to study the subject. Unfortunately, he found that he was only able to take drama courses at the time and this led to him discovering his acting abilities. He&nbsp;ended up transferring&nbsp;to Yale. Hamlin graduated with a dual bachelor's degree in psychology and drama in 1974.&nbsp;He then enrolled at the&nbsp; American Conservatory Theatre and graduated in 1976 with a Master of Fine Arts degree in acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-first-job-was-selling-lemonade><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her First Job Was Selling Lemonade</span></h2><p><a href=#>Lisa has never been afraid to work</a> for what she wants and even as a young child she was a hustler. She started selling lemonade from her home in Oregon. This allowed her to have the extra money she needed for things and gave her a taste of being in control and making her own money. That work ethic carried over to adulthood and she is still a hard worker.</p><h2 id=he-was-voted-people-magazine-s-sexiest-man-alive-in-1987><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Was Voted People Magazine's “Sexiest Man Alive” In 1987</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry fit right in the acting world and he earned a role as&nbsp;attorney Michael Kuzak in L.A. Law from 1986 to 1991. This also earned him&nbsp;three Golden Globe nominations and&nbsp;led to him being&nbsp;voted People Magazine's “Sexiest Man Alive” in 1987. It also started his career and led to more television show appearances and eventually roles in larger movies.</p><h2 id=she-was-a-track-and-tennis-star-in-high-school><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Was A Track And Tennis Star In High School</span></h2><p>It's clear that Lisa is someone who likes to be active and cares about her body. Her sleek build and tones muscles go all the way back to her high school days. Lisa wasn't just a pretty face in school. She was also a star on the tennis court and was a member of the school track team. She's also been known to run marathons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lisa Rinna Celebrates 24 Year Anniversary With Harry Hamlin With Adorable Throwback Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-attended-flintridge-preparatory-school-as-a-child><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Attended Flintridge Preparatory School As A Child</span></h2><p><a href=#>Harry has a great education</a> and as a child he attended Flintridge Preparatory School in California and later The Hill School in Pennsylvania. He did well in school and he was accepted into The University of California and later Yale. Education is important to Harry and Lisa and they both have big goals for their children.</p><h2 id=she-dropped-out-of-college><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Dropped Out Of College</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa knew at an early age that she was meant to be a performer and while she did well in school and did to plan college originally, she didn't complete her education. She graduated from high school in Oregon and enrolled in college. She dropped out a short time later to move to San Francisco so she could pursue her dreams of being a model and actress.</p><h2 id=he-played-soccer-and-lacrosse-in-college><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Played Soccer And Lacrosse In College</span></h2><p>Harry enjoys being active and taking care of his body. His ripped muscles come from working out and participating in a variety of sports and activities throughout his life. In college he played soccer and lacrosse. He also enjoys a variety of water sports.</p><h2 id=she-was-on-the-cover-of-playboy-magazine><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Was On The Cover Of Playboy Magazine</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Showing skin is something Lisa is good at and enjoys. Her Instagram is full of photos of her in skimpy swimsuit and crop tops. With a body like that, it's no wonder she likes to show it off and no wonder she landed on the cover on Playboy in 1998. She has even posed in racy photos while pregnant to prove that you can be still be sexy while pregnant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lisa Rinna Calls Launching Her Beauty Brand At 57 'Remarkable'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-married-twice-before-rinna><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Was Married Twice Before Rinna</span></h2><p>While Harry and Lisa have a happy life together, he was married twice before meeting her.
