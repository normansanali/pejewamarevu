But one of the photos stopped the shop owner, Aloyse Ball, cold. It showed a man, facing a Nazi firing squad with his hands tied behind his back, smiling. That man was Georges Blind.</p><p>But for a long time, no one knew the identity of the smiling man. Ball quietly <a href=# rel=noopener>made copies of the photo</a>, which he distributed to the French Resistance. Only after the war did Blind’s son, Jean, identify his father and tell his story.</p><p>Born on November 17, 1904, Georges Blind grew up to become a member of the fire brigade in the town of Belfort. He was dedicated to his job, and often went above and beyond in trying to save people.</p><p>“It has just been reported to me that… when called to rescue a person suffocated by the lighting gas, you succeeded after an hour and a half of efforts to revive the victim,” the mayor of Belfort <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote to Blind</a> in 1941. “Thus bringing a total of 21 the number of successes recorded to your credit.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343313 alt="Georges Blind" width=492 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/georges-blind-in-uniform.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343313 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Musée de la Résistance</span><span class=caption-body>Georges Blind in his fire brigade uniform.</span></p><p>As a member of the fire brigade, Blind was well-positioned to help the French Resistance. Though the Germans heavily occupied Belfort, Blind could easily move about town because of his job — even during the night. He and other fire brigade members helped transport Resistance members, weapons, information, and clandestine newspapers.</p><p>However, his activities eventually drew suspicion. The Nazis ended up arresting Blind on October 14, 1944. Soon afterward, they staged a mock execution to try and get Blind to talk. But instead, he just smiled.</p><p>Blind looked across the terrain at his would-be execution and grinned. He didn’t talk — he didn’t reveal any information about the French Resistance. And the Nazis grudgingly revealed it had all been a farce.</p><p>Tragically, however, Blind did not survive the war. Shortly after the photo was taken, he died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nevertheless, his image — his moment of quiet, cheerful bravery — lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzsdKiqq2ZnpiybrLIoJ%2BtnaKofHQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
