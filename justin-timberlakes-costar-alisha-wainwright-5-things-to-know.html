An onlooker told the outlet that the Raising Dion actress put her hand on Timberlake’s thigh and stroked his knee before the two held hands under the table.</p><p>The pair were on a break from filming their newest movie, Palmer, where they star as lovers. Timberlake, who is married to <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a>, was also shown putting his arm around Wainwright’s waist in a video obtained by The Sun. The “Cry Me a River” crooner, who appeared to have been drinking heavily, was not wearing his wedding ring in the snaps.</p><p>A representative for Wainwright addressed the dating rumors in a statement on Saturday, November 23: “There is no validity to this speculation. They are working on a project together.”</p><p>Timberlake and Wainwright are “just friends” a source told Us Weekly exclusively. “Several cast members were there and it was just a cast gathering,” the eyewitness explained. “Nothing remotely romantic is going on with Justin and Alisha. The whole cast is shooting out there and like to hang out together. They were very much in public and nothing inappropriate was happening.”</p><p>A second source added that the costars are ” like brother and sister.” “They are definitely not hooking up. She has been dating an actor who lives in LA,” the insider revealed.</p><p>Timberlake and Biel, 37, tied the knot in October 2012 after five years of dating. The couple welcomed their first child, son Silas, 4, in April 2015.</p><p>The “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” singer <a href=#>gushed about his wife</a> while delivering a speech at the 2019 Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony in New York City in June.</p><p>“To my wife, who is here tonight and who has given me the greatest <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> of love,” Timberlake said. “Our son is 4 now, and he’s dope too! I’ve written so many songs because of that that I’m so proud of and I just … I’m extremely humbled. I hope that I can represent this award for all of you.”</p><p>The 7th Heaven alum, meanwhile, <a href=#>dressed up as her hubby</a> during his ‘NSYNC days for Halloween. Biel donned a metallic jumpsuit and curly wig for her ’90s Timberlake costume and told Jimmy Fallon one week before the holiday that she never really listened to the band as a teen.</p><p>“We were hanging out again in Italy somewhere,” Biel said at the time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “We were trying to play Truth or Dare, which is the dumbest thing to do with a bunch of late 30-year-olds …. So, we just played Dare, and my dare was I have to sing an ‘NSYNC song, all the lyrics, all the melodies, and I literally … I couldn’t. I only know three words: ‘Bye, bye, bye,’ which I guess is one word three times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Who-Is-Alisha-Wainwright-5-Things-to-Know-About-Justin-Timberlakes-New-Costar-01.jpg><p>In light of the news of Timberlake’s recent outing, Us Weekly rounded up five things to know about Wainwright.</p><p><strong>1.
