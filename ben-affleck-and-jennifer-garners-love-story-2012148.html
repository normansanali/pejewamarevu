This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.”</p><p class=p1>The duo, whose <a href=#>divorce was finalized in October 2018</a>, have since been candid about their emotional split.</p><p class=p1>“The truth was, we took our time, we made a decision, we grew apart,” Affleck <a href=#>revealed on&nbsp;<span class=s1><i>T</i></span><i>he</i>&nbsp;<i>Howard Stern Show&nbsp;</i>in December 2021</a>. “We had a marriage that did not work. This happens. It is somebody I love and respect, but to whom I should not be married any longer. And then we said, ‘You know what? We tried. We tried because we had kids.’”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Good Will Hunting</i>&nbsp;star told host<a href=#> <strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> that he believed the former couple “would have ended up at each other’s throats” <a href=#>had they stayed married</a>, noting<span class=s1>&nbsp;at the time</span>, “Both of us felt like, ‘We don’t want this to be the model that our kids see of marriage.’”</p><p class=p2>Five years prior, <span class=s2>the&nbsp;<i>Alias&nbsp;</i>alum</span>&nbsp;shared her perspective on adjusting to life as coparents instead of partners.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t marry the big, fat movie star. I married him and I would go back and remake that decision,” Garner <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair&nbsp;</i>in March 2016</a>. “I ran down the beach to him and I would again. You can’t have three babies and so much of what we had. He’s the love of my life. He’s the most brilliant person in any room, the most charismatic, the most generous. He’s just a complicated guy. I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it.’ But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold. He can cast quite a shadow. … It’s not Ben’s job to make me happy. The main thing is these kids — and we’re completely&nbsp;in line&nbsp;with what we hope for them.”</p><p class=p1>Following their&nbsp;<span class=s1>split</span>, the Massachusetts native dated<span class=s1>&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Lindsay Shookus</strong></a> from 2017 to 2019, moving on with </span>his&nbsp;<i>Deep Water&nbsp;</i>costar <a href=#><strong>Ana&nbsp;<span class=s1>d</span>e Armas</strong>&nbsp;</a><span class=s1>from March 2020 to</span> January 2021.
