Michael Che gave an update on his pal and Saturday Night Live costar Colin Jost’s upcoming wedding to fiancée Scarlett Johansson.
During an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday, October 12, host Ellen DeGeneres asked the SNL writer, 37, whether he will be in the engaged couple’s wedding.
“I hope so, not if they want it to go over smoothly,” the comedian joked. “But if not, I would love to go and just disrupt everything, you know."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I think that’s going to be a big mistake.”</p><p>DeGeneres, 62, said that she would “love to be invited as well” because she’d “like to watch” Che in action. Meanwhile, the Weekend Update cohost replied: “You’ll be my plus one. It’ll be awesome.”</p><p>Jost, 38, <a href=#>began dating</a> Johansson, 35, in 2017 after connecting on the set of SNL.
