Springob had been a dedicated member of the Department for a lengthy period of 46 and a half years. Due to the generosity of the Springob family:<br>With heavy hearts, the Springob family shares the news that Francis “Frank” Springob passed away unexpectedly at home earlier this week. He was surrounded by his cherished wife of 53 years at the time of his passing. Frank was a charming and generous individual who possessed a large mind and a calm strength. He led a courageous life and loved wholeheartedly. He began his career as a police clerk and worked his way up through the ranks until he arrived at the position of Chief of Police for the City of Greenfield.</p><p>He served the city with great pride throughout his whole adult life. He was a very successful chief during his tenure, serving in leadership capacities for the Milwaukee County Law Enforcement Executives Association, the Wisconsin Police Chiefs Association, and on boards for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. During his tenure, he was also a significant contributor to the organisation.</p><p>Additionally, he was a member of the initial board of directors for the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Memorial, and he was quite enthusiastic about the establishment of the memorial in Madison. During the Vietnam War and the Milwaukee Civil Disorder of 1967, he also served as a Military Police Officer with the renowned 32nd Division of the Wisconsin National Guard, also known as the Red Arrow Brigade.</p><p>In addition to that, he was held in the highest regard and given the title of Kentucky Colonel. Frank retired from the Greenfield Police Department after 46 and a half years of devoted service to the community. He never forgot or abandoned the city that he considered to be his home. Even after he retired, Frank continued to provide assistance to individuals who were in need. He unselfishly donated his time to serve as the Cub Scout leader for his grandson.</p><p>Pack 38 came to regard him as an irreplaceable and venerable member due to his competence, selflessness, compassion, and commitment to the organisation. In addition, he was named to the Greenfield Police and Fire Commission during that time period, which allowed him to continue to commit himself to the Greenfield Police Department, which he cherished and to which he had devoted a significant portion of his life.</p><p>The position he held on the board was a tremendous honour, and he kindly maintained it until the very last day of his life.<br>The only thing that could compare to the profound thankfulness that Frank felt for his cherished family was the dutiful heart and enthusiastic concern that he had for the security and well-being of the community. His love for each and every one of them was unwavering, and he took great pleasure in the moments that they spent together.<br>Frank is survived by his devoted wife, his devoted sons and daughter-in-laws, his devoted grandchildren, his cherished great-grandchildren, his close sister-in-laws and brother-in-laws, whom he considered to be his siblings, a large number of nieces and nephews, and an innumerable number of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances. Having a genuine relationship with Frank was synonymous with loving and appreciating him; he will be remembered fondly and will be truly missed.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwstGapZyho2LAsb7Ip56oml2kr6rA1JqpsmWXp7KmusWinKWcXaW8rbXCnmSdnaCWv7W5xKerZp6fp7qmvoycn6KdlmK8p3nPqKOim5VitaK%2FjJ2gnpxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
