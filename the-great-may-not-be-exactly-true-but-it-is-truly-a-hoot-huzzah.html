Her reign as Empress of Russia lasted 34 years and helped raise the country from backward outlier to one of the great powers of Europe. Her plans to bring to Russia the Enlightenment – with its love of science, art and reason, and its passion for individual liberty (the question of extending it beyond the nobility was, of course, negotiable) – was a success.</p><p>But history and <i>The Great</i> are but distant cousins: the truest thing in the series is the disclaimer that it is only “an occasionally true story”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.126%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/482db42b2871ad23396be817217ae939baf14b6f><p>Case in point: Catherine was just 15 when she married Peter and 33 when the coup to unseat him took place, at which point he had been on the throne for a mere six months. In <i>The Great</i>, Peter appears to have been in power forever, while Catherine’s usurpation takes place over a year at most. And while the real Peter died in the coup, the fact Nicholas Hoult is one of the show’s executive producers suggests he probably intends to hang around as long as possible.</p><p>Does any of that matter? Not really. <i>The Great</i> is a lavish romp, full of sex and violence and filthy put-downs. And while it mostly plays as farce, it also has something to say about the inevitable compromises that must be made if idealism is to translate to the reality of pulling the levers of power.</p><p>It may not be exactly true, in other words, but neither is it untrue. It’s a riot, in every way imaginable and a lot of fun. And for that let us say huzzah!</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybrPRnpitZZ2Wxm66zq1km51dmsWir9OlsGasoqqybq7UrWSirF2ewG7A0a6jsmWRYrWwu9Nmn66yqpa1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
