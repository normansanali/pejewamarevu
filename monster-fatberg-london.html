An 820 foot long fatberg has been found blocking a sewer in East London, and it is taking a lot of man power to get it out of the way. The fatberg, a solid mass of congealed fat, wet wipes, diapers, oil, and condoms was found in a Victorian-era tunnel in Whitechapel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Thames Water company said it was the largest they had ever seen and estimated the removal time at three weeks.</p><p>The fatberg weighs about 143 tons and is 820 feet long. For reference, that’s 20 feet longer than London’s Tower Bridge. It’s also about the same weight as a blue whale, earth’s largest animal.</p><p>Matt Rimmel, the head of the Thames Water’s waste network, expressed his shock at the fatberg and reminded everyone of how easily-avoided they are. Most fatbergs are caused by people putting things down their sinks and toilets that should be thrown in the garbage.</p><p>“It’s frustrating, as these situations are totally avoidable and caused by fat, oil, and grease being washed down sinks and wipes flushed down the loo,” he said.</p><p>Rimmer hopes the fatberg will remind people of the importance of proper waste disposal.</p><p>“The sewers are not an abyss for household rubbish,” he said. “Our message to everyone is clear – please bin it – don’t block it.”</p><p>Due to its immense size, removing the fatberg takes a lot of work. “It’s a total monster and taking a lot of manpower and machinery to remove as it’s set hard,” said Rimmer.</p><p>Eight workers will try to break up the fatberg using high-pressure hoses. They will then use tankers to suck up the pieces and take them to a recycling site in Stratford.</p><p>Despite the plan in place, it won’t be easy.</p><p>“It’s basically like trying to break up concrete,” Rimmer said.</p><p>Though this is the largest one found, the issue of fatbergs is one that has been plaguing London for years. In 2013, the Thames Water company found a bus-sized fatberg in a sewer in Kingston-upon-Thames.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-130919 alt="2013 Fatberg" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-460462748.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-130919 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Adrian Dennis/ Getty Images </span><span class=caption-body>A Thames Water worker holds a piece from the fatberg found in 2013</span></p><p>A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council acknowledged the issue and the city’s plan for the future.</p><p>“We know this is a major issue across London,” he said. “We have set up a waste oil collection point with Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, and strongly encourage businesses to set up collection contracts for their waste oil with companies for recycling.”</p><p>Enjoyed this?
