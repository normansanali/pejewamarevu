Pregnancy, Kids?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-29</div><p>Toby Mac and Amanda Levy have had a few divine interventions in their life. The pair are devoted to God, something which is reflected in Mac’s songs. While Amanda is a relatively unknown figure, her husband Toby is a Christian hip-hop recording artist, music producer, songwriter, and author. Over the years, Toby has tasted success as an artist and has released seven single albums, Momentum (2001), Welcome to Diverse City (2004), Portable Sounds (2007), Tonight (2010), Eye on It (2012), This Is Not a Test (2015), and The Elements (2018). But in spite of Toby’s fame, not much is known about Amanda. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the life of Amanda Levy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Amanda Levy Mckeehan was born on the 9th of January 1971, in Jamaica. Born to Judy and Robert Levy of the Jamaica Broilers, Levy spent most of her early life in Jamaica. As a young kid, Levy loved the music scene of Jamaica and it was through her work in music that she met her husband, TobyMac. The pair tied the knot in 1994, and Levy moved with Mac to the United States. Not much is known about her education and details on Levy’s career have never been revealed to the media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Toby-Mac-wife-Amanda-Levy-Mckeehan.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Children:</h2><p>Levy and Mac have a total of four children, Truett, twins Moses and Marlee, Leo, and Judah. Of the four children, Truett, best known as TruDog or Tru, was born on the 4th of September, 1998. He decided to follow in his father’s footsteps into Christian Hip hop and often collaborated with his father. However, the young artist passed away unfortunately on the 23rd of October, 2019. Tru was found dead on October 23, 2019, at his home in Nashville, after the Fire Department responded to a cardiac arrest report. While no reasons for death were given at the moment, the autopsy revealed that Tru had died due to an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the death of his son, Toby <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> an inspiring tribute praising god.&nbsp;</p><p>“Truett always had a soft spot for God. The Bible moved him. His heart was warm to the things of his King. He was by no means a cookie-cutter Christian but give me a believer who fights to keep believing. Give me a broken man who recognizes his need for a Savior every time. That’s who Truett was and how he should be remembered.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The hike for the twins:</h2><p>After the birth of Tru in 1998, Levy could not get pregnant. The pair tried everything from fertility cures to medicines. But when nothing worked, the doctors wanted Levy to undergo surgery to find out what was wrong. While the pair agreed at the moment, Mac felt a tingling and asked Levy not to go through. Instead, the pair decided to pray for 30 days straight. They got specific and asked for twins on the 5th day and on the 10th day, an unknown person came up to them and asked if they would like to adopt.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair quickly agreed and prepared a parents’ portfolio. Luckily for them, the mother chose them and the paperwork was done quickly. However, following the birth of the twins, the mother decided that she didn’t want to give them up and told Levy and Mac the same. The couple was left distraught and rejected another offer to adopt a baby boy. After a couple of weeks, the twins’ mother called the pair and asked if they would like to take the baby off her hands. Levy and Mac agreed and adopted Moses and Marlee in 2002. Levy had no problem getting pregnant after the incident and gave birth to her second child, Leo, born on November 2, 2004, followed by Judah who was born on March 24, 2006.</p><p>The pair have been adamant about their faith in God and have justified it on multiple occasions. Following the death of Tru, Toby<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> tweeted</a> about their faith in God.</p><p>“My wife and I would want the world to know this: We don’t follow God because we have some sort of under-the-table deal with Him, like, we’ll follow you if you bless us. We follow God because we love Him. It’s our honor. He is the God of the hills and the valleys. And He is beautiful above all things.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Toby Mac:</h2><p>TobyMac (stylized as TobyMac) is an American Christian hip-hop recording artist, songwriter, producer, and author.
