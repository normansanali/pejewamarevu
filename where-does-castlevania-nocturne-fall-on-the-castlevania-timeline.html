The timeline of the Castlevania animated universe involves and utilizes dozens of games released in the last 30 years. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">original 4-season series</a> adapted its first two seasons from the 1989 game Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse, followed by 2005’s Castlevania: Curse of Darkness in the second season, and 1997’s Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for Alucard’s backstory.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>In the original series, we saw Dracula rising in revenge for the persecution and execution of his human wife, and Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard teaming up to bring him down. The vampire uprising is resurrected in Castlevania: Nocturne, 300 years and 1,400 miles away from where Dracula first appeared. So, where then does the impending spin-off series sit in the chronology?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-does-castlevania-nocturne-take-place data-injectable=false>When does Castlevania: Nocturne take place?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Castlevania: Nocturne takes place at the end of the 18th century during the historic French Revolution, more than 300 years after the original series. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It will be based and inspired, by the Castlevania: Rondo of Blood video game</a>, first released in 1993. There will be a huge shift in the series’ setting, entering the streets of France in place of the English monarchy.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Drawing from the video game timeline, the original Castlevania was set in 1476 A.D. (Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse), and the upcoming sequel, Castlevania: Nocturne, will be set in 1792 A.D. (Rondo of Blood), as confirmed by Netflix during the Geeked Week 2022. This sets the exact time shift to 316 years after the original series.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Fans will most likely witness the establishment of the French Republic on September 22, 1792, in the upcoming series. With neoclassical architecture seen in the buildings and characters sporting revolutionary Frannch clothing, such as ruffled jabot collars and double-breasted jackets, the series trailer has already hinted at the new setting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Castlevania: Nocturne characters: Is Richter Trevor’s son?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/castlevania-nocturne.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Given the significant time shift, a direct descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, Richter Belmont will take center stage as our valiant hero in Castlevania: Nocturne, charged with the harrowing mission — to thwart the approaching vampire apocalypse that hangs over the entire world. Unlike the popular rumor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Richter is not the son of Trevor</a>, but he can be anywhere from 4 to 10 generations down the Belmont family tree.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Richter will be joined by Maria Renard, a French revolutionary, and Annette, a young sorceress and ex-slave from the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Erzsebet Báthory, a vampire queen modeled after the real-life Hungarian noblewoman, will serve the antagonist side as she sends vampires on a mission to conquer the world and carry out the prophecy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Castlevania: Nocturne plot: What happens in the video game vs. series?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ezq1VfeWQAMn7Q9.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Despite the fact that Castlevania: Nocturne is undoubtedly a sequel spin-off, it decided against picking up where the fourth season left off. Instead, it forges ahead into unexplored terrain, promising a narrative that is both thrilling and unpredictable. Though the exact deets of the series plot are still shrouded in mystery, the series might derive from its immersive video game source plot.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>In the Rondo of Blood, Dark Priest Shaft reanimates the Dark Lord, who subsequently assaults ladies from the nearby village, one of whom was Richter Belmont’s fiancée Annette. Richter swiftly finds and saves her, but has a bigger responsibility now. In order to prevent the vampires from bringing about the end of the world in France, the descendant of the Belmont family continues to fight them with the assistance of the enigmatic Maria Renard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>The involvement of Maria and Annette is confirmed by the series’ official cast list. Yet, in a surprising twist, Castlevania: Nocturne appears to be steering away from the traditional revival of Dracula. Instead, it hints at Erzsebet Báthory taking center stage as the central antagonist, adding an intriguing layer of complexity to the story.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Catch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castlevania: Nocturne on Netflix, starting Sept. 28, 2023</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZrCglaeybrDOnqpmm5Gowa2x1Zqlopldo7ykwNSrpZ5llpa5rXnOp2StoJVisKK%2F06Wcr5menq5uwMimnKWhnpp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
