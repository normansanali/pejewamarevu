Once Dave got word of the mix-up, he took to Twitter in an attempt to clear the air, stating "AGAIN I APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK TIME TO COME MEET ME TODAY. I WANNA SET UP A FREE SHOW/MEET & GREET FOR THEM." When Dave was initially accused, he claimed that he never knew about it in the first place.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Dave took things up a notch and went after Kendra G on Instagram, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allegedly writing</a>: "I wanna apologize to everybody in that room except this chicc [Kendra G]. I was not told by anybody to be there today," he wrote in a now since-deleted IG post. "It's good to know how [Kendra G] feel thou u was just talking about getting pregnant by me if you could. I wouldn't touch you with gloves on.&nbsp;Chicago, I love y'all and would never ever curve anything in y'all city," he continued. "[Kendra G], you'll never get an interview, a drop not even a conversation from me ever in this lifetime. That is not professional and I don't move like that."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kendra G fired back at East, going off in retaliation on a post of her own, which you can check out below.</p><p>Dave East Goes To War With Chicago Radio Host Kendra G</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
