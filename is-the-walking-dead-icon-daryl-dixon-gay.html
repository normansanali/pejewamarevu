As a result, many viewers have scratched their heads for years and wondered if Daryl is gay — despite a strong majority of the fanbase suggesting that Daryl and Carol (Melissa McBride) should become an item.</p><h2 id=h-is-daryl-dixon-gay data-injectable=false>Is Daryl Dixon gay?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-walking-dead-daryl-dixon-promo-image-1-e1689614144713.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>Although some folks have felt convinced of Daryl’s sexuality for a while now, it only took a few comments from TWD creator Robert Kirkman to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clear up the rumors</a> once and for all. In a 2014 interview with ABC, Kirkman confirmed that Dixon is “actually straight,” although he recently expressed that he wouldn’t be opposed to changing up Daryl’s developmental arc <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in his new spin-off series</a>, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. In fact, Kirkman detailed that the original plans were for Dixon to be gay, but it simply never happened.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>On that same note, Reedus simultaneously expressed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he “isn’t afraid”</a> to portray Daryl as a gay character and that he would happily work with whatever material the writers gave him. So while Dixon isn’t currently gay canonically, that doesn’t mean that plans won’t soon change down the line as the character’s story continues to expand in the latest pulse-pounding series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn55lp5a5rLXNoGSdnZGZeqqvzqdknZmirrlusMixpqdll5bGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
