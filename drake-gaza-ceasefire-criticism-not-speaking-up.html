Earlier this week, a large group of artists banded together as Artists4Ceasefire to send a lengthy open letter to President Joe Biden and the United States Congress. The letter urges them to take action immediately to end the loss of life in the conflict — a conflict which has killed around 1,400 Israelis and over 7,300 Palestinians since it began on October 7 with an attack by Hamas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s horrific,” he said. “And I put out a statement about that myself. I said, you know, that I feel sorry for all the citizens from Israel and Palestine that are caught up in what their leaders are choosing to do.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “It’s a serious topic. And when I sat back and looked at it, I was like, ‘Drake is the most famous Jewish person on Earth’ … and Khaled is the most famous Palestinian in the world. But neither one of them has said anything about this at all.”</p><p>“Drake is doing this whole thing where he’s&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>literally writing paragraphs about Joe Budden</a> because his feelings were hurt about an album review,” Vlad concluded. “So it’s not like they don’t have time. This shit runs deep.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Meanwhile, the 6 God’s longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib — who also signed the Artists4Ceasefire letter to President Biden — <a class=underline-link href=#>spoke out against the conflict in Gaza earlier this month</a>.</p><p>40 has taken a firm stance against the war that has dominated the global news cycle. In his statement, he spoke against Israeli “colonialism” and advocated for people across the world to “stand with Palestine” in the face of Israel’s heavy bomb attack and looming ground invasion.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/macklemore-denounces-israels-attacks-on-gaza-i-stand-for-a-free-palestine-250x142.png alt="Macklemore Denounces Israel’s Attacks On Gaza: ‘I Stand For A Free Palestine’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Macklemore Denounces Israel’s Attacks On Gaza: ‘I Stand For A Free Palestine’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 20, 2023</p></a><p>“I live in Canada,” he began. “One of the worlds most brutally violent colonial regimes. Still in active genocides against indigenous peoples. It’s hard to speak as I sit here benefiting from colonial violence to the highest degree.</p><p>“Believing in both the human rights of Palestinians and the right and need of a Jewish state has meant I have always had friends on both sides. And beyond the physical war, seeing them be pushed into extremism by such acts of violence is distressing.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He added: “This is what colonialism looks like. It’s what it’s always looked like. When will this stop? When will life win over death? The world did not come and stand with the Jewish people during the holocaust. Now we watch as the world does not come and stand with Palestine. I’m ashamed and devastated by it all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibq5mbmnqordmaZJydkaiyp7XRnmScqpmptqS10qZkp6ekYsCxscCkoKefXaq9</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
