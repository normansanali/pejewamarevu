The previously-made Jahan Jaaeyega Hamen Paaeyega was directed by his nephew Janmendra alias Dumpy, who was 17 years of age at that time.

Govinda also appeared in the song "Deewangi Deewangi", from Om Shanti Om starring ShahRukh Khan.</p><p>In 2013 Govinda co-starred with Priyanka Chopra in K. C. Bokadia's box office failure, Deewana Main Deewana, which had been made about ten years earlier. The film, a Hindi remake of the Tamil film Priyamudan, was directed by Vincent Selva; Govinda's performance as a villain was praised. He made his Bengali debut as a deputy inspector general of police in Dipak Sanyal's Samadhi, co-starring <a href=#>Gracy Singh</a> and <a href=#>Sayali Bhagat</a>, another box office failure.</p><p>Govinda has made 5 films with Shilpa Shetty: Aag, Hathkadi, The Gambler, Chhote Sarkar and Pardesi Babu; 4 films with <a href=#>Lara Dutta</a> (Bhagam Bhag, Partner, Do Knot Disturb and Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai), and 3 with Rani Mukerji: Hadh Kar Di Aapne, Pyaar Diwana Hota Hai and Chalo Ishq Ladaaye. Govinda made 2 films with Amitabh Bachchan – Hum and Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan. He has also made 2 films with Rajnikant – Hum and Ghairqanooni.</p><p>In 2011 he appeared in Jagmohan Mundhra's adult comedy, Naughty @ 40.

On 5 February 2009, Rai filed a complaint against Govinda, accusing him of assault and crime, in the Borivali Magistrate Court. In 2013, the court ruled against Rai. In 2014, Rai took his case to the Supreme Court. He said that he had come to Mumbai to become an actor, and felt very humiliated when he was slapped by Govinda. According to Rai, he had contested the case for six years and had spent ₹500,000–600,000 on attorney fees. Since the actor did not apologise, he was more determined to fight him in court. In December 2015, the Supreme Court asked Govinda to apologise to Rai for slapping him and settle the whole matter out of the court immediately in the span of two weeks. The actor said that he "respects" the court's decision, and will decide when he receives it in writing.</p><p>In 2008 Govinda appeared in Money Hai Toh Honey Hai, directed by Bollywood choreographer <a href=#>Ganesh Acharya</a>, which was a box office failure.

That year Salman Khan invited Dhawan and Govinda on his show, 10 Ka Dum, to celebrate the success of Partner.</p><p>Govinda's film-star status could explain his inaccessibility to his constituents but not his absence from parliament.

At the same time, he continued his film career while he was serving as an MP. Indeed, his career witnessed a comeback of sorts in 2007, after the release of Partner. He was pilloried in the press for the combination of continuing to act in films while being generally absent from parliament, and inaccessible to his constituents. On 20 January 2008, Govinda decided to leave politics and concentrate on his Bollywood acting career.</p><p>His first release of 2007 was director Nikhil Advani's big-budget drama, Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love.

Although the film was a box office disappointment, Govinda's performance was praised.</p><p>Govinda made a comeback to films in late 2006 with the comedy Bhagam Bhag (directed by Priyadarshan), in which he appeared with Akshay Kumar and <a href=#>Lara Dutta</a>. It was Govinda and Kumar's first film together.</p><p>Govinda (a member of the Indian National Congress) was elected the seventh member of parliament for the Mumbai North constituency of Maharashtra, India in the 14th Lok Sabha elections in 2004, defeating Ram Naik of the Bharatiya Janata Party.</p><p>Govinda then joined the Indian National Congress.

He had no new film releases in 2004 and 2005, although some of his delayed films were released during this time, (such as 2005's Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen and Ssukh— produced by Govinda and directed by his brother, Kirti Kumar and 2006's Sandwich) which were box office failures.</p><p>After a series of several unsuccessful films in the 2000s, his later commercial successes included Bhagam Bhag (2006), Partner (2007), Life Partner (2009), and Holiday (2014) .

Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta and Akhiyon Se Goli Maare.</p><p>He played a villain for the first time in his career in Shikari (2000). Although the movie was not a commercial success, Govinda's convincing portrayal of a sociopathic murderer was critically acclaimed. He turned down roles in Taal, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha and Devdas, all of which were successful.</p><p>In 1999, Govinda was voted the world's tenth-greatest star of stage or screen in a BBC News Online poll.
