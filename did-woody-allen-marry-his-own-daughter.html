His longtime partner Mia Farrow’s adoptive daughter, Soon-Yi, was his actual adopted child. Depending on the duration and nature of their relationship, Mia and Allen may qualify as a common law spouse under the law.<br>Since December 1991, Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen have been dating (Soon-Yi was 21 years old). They got hitched on December 24, 1997, in Venice.</p><p>Mia Farrow and André Previn’s adoptive daughter is Soon-Yi Previn. This explains why she goes as Soon-Yi Previn rather than Soon-Yi Allen. Stunning, no?</p><p>Mia Farrow and Woody Allen have been dating for 12 years. However, they were never wed and did not live together. Woody Allen resided in a Fifth Avenue apartment. On Central Park West, Mia Farrow and her children resided. In reality, during the course of 12 years, Woody never once spent the night at Mia’s apartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51ksaqwjLCmqJypYq6tuMSnZKaZoqfGbrTIrGSor55isaLBxqGrnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
