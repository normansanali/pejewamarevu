It was the first child for both Mulaney, 39, and Munn, 41, but the happy news was overshadowed by the real or perceived drama surrounding the comedian’s personal life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Mulaney’s relationship (and later pregnancy) with Munn was revealed in the immediate fallout of news that he and his now-estranged wife Anna Marie Tendler were separating. And as such, many fans who had previously rooted on Mulaney and Tendler for their “couple goals” felt personally betrayed.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>For her part, Tendler has not opened up on their breakup, other than commenting that she was “heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage” <a href=#>through a spokesperson</a> in May. Still, that hasn’t stopped folks from pouring through the artist’s Instagram and TikTok accounts to search for clues, where <a href=#>she seems to be thriving</a>.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>But on Sunday, just two days after <a href=#>TMZ broke the baby news</a>, Tendler may have finally given the people what they’ve been wanting with a well-timed Instagram post. “Norman F******g Rockwell,” Tendler captioned the photo, in which she was pictured sitting in front of a large elaborate mirror, looking morose.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Anna Marie Tendler (@annamtendler)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>It didn’t take long for would-be detectives to begin breaking down the cryptic post.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>“<a href=#>Norman F***ing Rockwell</a>,” as many are aware, is the title track of Lana Del Rey’s 2019 album. And the lyrics are, uh, not super subtle!</p><p>Godamn, man child<br>You fucked me so good that I almost said, “I love you”<br>You’re fun and you’re wild<br>But you don’t know the half of the shit that you put me through<br>Your poetry’s bad and you blame the news<br>But I can’t change that and I can’t change your mood</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>A jab at Mulaney, perhaps? Depending on who you ask, the answer ranges from “there’s a very good chance” to “almost freaking certainly.”</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>“You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two,” reads another lyric of the song, which could even be interpreted as a reference to Mulaney’s height. And suffice to say, people were absolutely titillated with the shade.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>“Another piece to analyze every pixel of,” commented one sleuth. “Lana del Rey reference?? Okay!!!!” added another excited fan. “It’s just what they do sis,” quipped yet another user.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>And if Tendler was indeed shading her ex, it seems as though she has good reason. Previously, Mulaney opened up about his stints in rehab, separation from Tendler, relationship with Munn, and pregnancy during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers in September.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>“In the spring, I went to Los Angeles and met and started to date a wonderful woman named Olivia – Olivia Munn,” <strong>Mulaney</strong> told Meyers at the time. “And we’re having a baby together … I’m going to be a dad. We’re both really, really happy.”</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>However, counting backward, the November birthday seems to throw off his timeline. If <strong>Munn</strong> went full-term, it seems more likely that she got pregnant in February or March. It’s unclear whether Mulaney was still with Tendler at the time, but things considered, she may have actually been quite the restrained comment.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>On the other hand, Lana Del Rey lyrics are always appropriate Instagram captions as the world burns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8CnpZplnZa%2FqrGMrZynnJyav26%2Fx5qbnqtdn7ypuoymrKWZnprGbq7Iq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
