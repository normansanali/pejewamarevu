These regions are characterized by cold and windy conditions, as well as harsh sunlight. Moreover, there’s a minimal supply of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis at high altitudes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-the-alpine-tundra></span>What are the characteristics of the alpine tundra?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>characteristic of the Alpine</b> is similar to polar <b>tundra</b> in that it has no trees, has annual temperatures that are recorded to be very low, and most animals migrate to these regions only during the productive summer periods.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-are-alpine-plants-described></span>How are alpine plants described?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Alpines</b> are compact <b>plants</b> that usually produce lots of tiny jewel-like <b>flowers</b> in vibrant colours. <b>Alpines</b> encompass a range of <b>plants</b> from bulbs, shrubs and herbaceous perennials.
