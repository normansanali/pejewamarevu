Peddling on the side of the road in his Meridian, Idaho, neighborhood was his son, Nick, and his two friends — Erik Nielson and Adam Cluff. 
 Erik is the deacons quorum president in the Meridian 12 Ward, Meridian Idaho West Stake. Adam and Nick are his two counselors.
 When Hintze asked the boys what they were up to, they enthusiastically held up bags of cookies and explained that they were delivering the goodies to other deacons in their ward."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He also encouraged Johnson to utilize the Leadership Lessons and report back with his observations.</p><p>The Leadership Lessons “have been great training for the boys,” Johnson told the Church News.</p><p>“This is obviously the first time they’ve served in a priesthood quorum or been asked to lead. So it’s been fun to see them listen and learn and participate. They’ve been awesome.”</p><p>The Leadership Lessons, he added, are designed to prompt discussion among the boys. The boys ask about how to care for others. And they are taking ownership of their own quorum, even amidst the challenges of the ongoing pandemic.</p><p>In a recent deacons quorum presidency meeting, the young leaders and their advisers discussed the needs of fellow quorum members, including a few boys who were not participating in activities. Erik and his counselors volunteered to make home visits during the week to fellow deacons.</p><p>“The boys decided to bake cookies together and deliver them,” said Johnson. “They did it all on their own. They even made two different kinds of cookies, which surprised me.”</p><p>Watching 12-year-old boys becoming “take-action priesthood leaders” inspires Johnson. He’s grateful for the Leadership Lessons and other resources helping young men and young women answer calls to serve.</p><p>“The lessons help spark so many conversations on how to best lead the quorum,” he said. “They are learning about ministering and planning meeting agendas and activities. The leadership lessons are pretty short and the content is just right.”</p><p>Nick, the deacons quorum presidency second counselor, said the weekly presidency meetings and the lessons “have taught me how to reach out to people, especially those who aren’t coming to the activities.”</p><p>First counselor Adam said their labors are already yielding fruit.</p><p>“We went to one deacon’s house and personally invited him to the activities — and now he’s coming.”</p><p>The key, they added, is getting to know each quorum member and planning activities that they will want to join.</p><p>President Erik Nielson said the things happening in his quorum can be done in any quorum or Young Women class anywhere in the world.</p><p>“Just be friendly. Let people know that you care — and then have fun with them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfZ31zfI5yZmtrX2eAc32VcW5xZ5SarqS7zaxkmpmipLuqr4ypqaKdo6m1sLvDZqiup6KqurR5y56YnZ2iqLWqvIylnKyrn6PAbrXDmp%2Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
