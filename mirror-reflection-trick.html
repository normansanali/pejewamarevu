The optical illusion can be seen on the reflector.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The viral TikTok trend can blow your mind for a while. It is spreading like wildfire on TikTok these days. The videos showing the effect have been viewed over a million times as people try to understand the video.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a title=@ideatimes href=#>@ideatimes</a> Why?Try this trick<a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=useful href=#>#useful</a> <a title=why href=#>#why</a> <a title=cool href=#>#cool</a> <a title=physics href=#>#physics</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=learnontiktok href=#>#learnontiktok</a> <a title=ideatimes href=#>#ideatimes</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a> <a title="♬ Pagodão do Birimbola (Tchubirabirom) - Os Quebradeiras & Machadez & Mousik" href=#>♬ Pagodão do Birimbola (Tchubirabirom) - Os Quebradeiras & Machadez & Mousik</a> Egg Mirror Trick ( Source : <a class=imagesource href=#>tiktok</a> )</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Those who find it a head-scratching topic make reels seeking answers through their followers. If you want to try the trick following are the things you need to have with you.</span></p><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A piece of paper</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>An Egg</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A Stickum</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A Reflector</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Here are a few steps to enjoy the trend on TikTok:</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Step 1: Prepare The Required Items</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The initial step to try the scheme starts with glue, paper, and the looking glass. You need to stick that piece of paper against the glass using strong glue. Make sure they are properly stuck and won't fall.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Step 2: Hold An Egg Against The Reflector</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>An egg is an object to try this 'magic.' You need to hold the one against the reflector. It should be laid on paper so that the looking glass can't see the object directly.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After all, the whole practice is to find out how the glass sees any object behind the paper.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Step 3: Open TikTok and Click on the 'Plus Icon'</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Now you can open your TikTok app and click the 'plus icon' to start recording. You will see the option to choose whether to make a video of one minute or 15 seconds.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Press the start button and can record the reel of the ploy. First, capture the object from the front and change the angle by right to record the reflection.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The alternative way to make a TikTok post of the trend is to record the film from the camera. Open the app and add the recorded tape from the gallery.</span></p><h2 id=trend-described>Trend Described</h2><p>TikTok mirror trend explained with 90 degree reflection theory. Users claimed the image seen in the mirror isn't actually the object but an optical illusion.</p><p>The trend inclined to the hype astonishingly. The platform is full of videos with people's shocked reactions to something that many have learned in high school. Surprisingly, those kind of videos on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> has over million views with people commenting it is a magic!</p><a title=@jacobtaylorstarks href=#>@jacobtaylorstarks</a> <a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @hankgreen1 my brain is breaking !! <a title=objectbehindpaperonthemirror href=#>#objectbehindpaperonthemirror</a> <a title=mirrortricks href=#>#mirrortricks</a> <a title=hankgreen href=#>#hankgreen</a> <a title=science href=#>#science</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Jacob Starks" href=#>♬ original sound - Jacob Starks</a> Mirror Tricks ( Source : <a class=imagesource href=#>tiktok</a> )<p>Repeating the theory from high school science, here is the explaimation about how the trend works. Actually, the image that people see in the looking glass isn't an another object, its just an optical illusion created by the reflection.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When a ray of light reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.&nbsp;</li><li>Therefore, both incident ray and reflected ray are at 0 degrees.</li></ul><p>Reflection of Light explains when a ray of light appraoches a smooth polished surface and the light ray bounces back.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=reason-behind-the-object->Reason Behind The Object Behind Mirror Mystery</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The object behind the paper in a mirror can be seen because of the law of reflection. The paper acts as a background for the image and has zero impact on the reflection.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A simple yet puzzling mirror experiment went viral on social platforms like TikTok, recently. The essential factor to understand the issue is a diffuse reflection which makes our vision possible.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a title=@matt.math href=#>@matt.math</a> Replying to @shannon_said Does adding a laser help? Let me know! This mirror reflection stuff can be tricky until it “clicks.” <a title=mattmath href=#>#mattmath</a> <a title=boredengineer href=#>#boredengineer</a> <a title=furby href=#>#furby</a> <a title=mirror href=#>#mirror</a> <a title=physics href=#>#physics</a> <a title=stem href=#>#stem</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Matt" href=#>♬ original sound - Matt</a> TikTok Paper and Mirror Trick ( Source : <a class=imagesource href=#>tiktok</a> )</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Our eyes collect every single ray that reflects toward its position. That is how we see objects. The assumed magic of seeing an object behind the glass is also possible due to diffuse reflection. Likewise, we see ourselves in the mirror with the same logic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, with the 90-degree reflection law, when you hold any particular thing to the mirror, you can see that thing reflecting in the other direction at the same angle as your grip angle, most likely the paper to have no impact on that reflection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In other words, by changing the position of our head( moving close to the mirror), we can see the light reflected from the mirror toward any position.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Does A Mirror See Behind Paper?</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The mirror sees behind the paper because of the reflection light. It is not a mystery but basic physics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The answer to this question is understanding what mirrors are all about. Youtuber Danny Nicholson made a minute and 19-second-long video on his channel to explain the trending matter even better.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Since light bounces off mirrors when you put them at a certain angle, they bounce off the mirror and land at the object. That’s what the mirror shows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Where did the question come from? Bailey Caviness first uploaded a reel saying, "Can someone please tell me how this works?" on&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TikTok</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;a few days earlier.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mirror Paper Trick Explained ( Source : <a class=imagesource href=#>youtube</a> )</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the video, she has a piece of paper against the reflector and holding a gum box. She asked her followers to teach her how the mirror shows the reflection of the same thing that was behind the paper.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Few people commented the actual science behind it, while others commented using their humorous skills. One of the replies read, "The same way your eyeball knows it's there is the same way your camera knows it's there" while another wrote, "You didn't learn about how lights work in science class?"</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So how was the reaction of TikTokers and viewers to the trend?</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>People find the trend funny and confusing at the same time. One of the reactors and social media influencer, Today Years Old, wrote," This trend is funny cause half of my brain thinks it makes sense but half my brain is confused.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGikoqqipL9uvsSfo56bpJ68r3nTq6Ccow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
