This move seemed to work because in 2005, the young singer met Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was about to launch his independent record label, Big Machine Records. And with just 16 years, Taylor became the label’s first-ever signee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This led to the release of her debut album, Taylor Swift, in 2006. The album, as well as Swift’s songwriting abilities, were highly-praised by the critics and Taylor was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards and, eventually, got a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Her next to albums, Fearless and Speak Now, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. And she worked with BMR until the release of her sixth album, Reputation, in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ten People Taylor Swift Has Called Out By Name In Her Songs</a></span></p><p>Shortly after releasing her polarizing album, Swift left Borchetta’s label and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group. This would later lead to her <a href=#>feud with Scooter Braun</a> over the ownership of her songs.</p><p>Even though she’s focused on creating new music, working on albums like Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights, ever since 2021, Taylor Swift has also been releasing re-recorded versions of her older albums. All of this in an attemp to gain control and ownership of the songs' original recordings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ever-since-she-started-writing-taylor-incorporates-her-life-into-her-songs>Ever Since She Started Writing, Taylor Incorporates Her Life Into Her Songs</h2><p>It’s no secret that plenty of Taylor Swift’s songs take inspiration from the singer’s personal life. And even though she’s never admitted to it, fans think many of her songs have been written to some of her most notorious ex-boyfriends. A clear example of this is All Too Well, a song fans believe talks about <a href=#>Taylor’s relationship with Jake Gyllenhal</a>.</p><p>Of course, fans can’t stop talking about this song since Taylor recently released its re-recording. She also released All Too Well: The Short Film, a 15-minute movie of the never-heard-before 10 minutes, starring <a href=#>Dylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift revealed why she chooses to write about her personal experience and love life in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concert special for Netflix</a>. “When I write a song, it’s usually me just trying to get past something and understand something I’m going through by writing about it and that was definitely the case when I wrote the next song that I’m going to play.”, Swift admitted.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-revealed-she-doesn-rsquo-t-make-the-first-move-when-texting-prospective-romantic-partners>Taylor Swift Revealed She Doesn’t Make The First Move When Texting Prospective Romantic Partners</h2><p>Most recently, a magazine released a list of the singer’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nine rules for dating</a>.

You can't ever send two text messages in a row,” she said. “If they don't answer your text messages, then that's fine. Don't stress it out and send another text message.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor’s rules when it comes to texting prospective romantic interest can be summarized as keeping her cool and showing she’s interest without doing all the work.
