Dr. Lauren Thielen’s (Dr. T) sister Mariah’s five-year-old turtle, Gallagher, is the first patient. She is showing signs of distress when in the water. She cannot sink properly and is struggling to navigate swimming, which is unusual for a slider turtle.</p><p>“Why the heck can’t she swim,” asks Dr. T as she tries to determine what is making Gallagher, the slider turtle, so off her game in the sink and swim tasks.</p><p>An ultrasound is used to figure out what is making Gallagher have difficulty in swimming, and the good news is that despite having swollen follicles, it turns out that it is a case of bad turtle gas.</p><p>Before the gas diagnosis, Dr. T thinks Gallagher might be egg bound.&nbsp; She says: “I took a look at Gallagher’s x-rays, and there’s no eggs,” worried now that there is something in the abdomen of the turtle that is problematic.</p><p>But the good news is that the follicle crisis is averted, and in our exclusive clip, Dr. T explains she has taken the gassy turtle home and hopes to have the reptile pass some turtle gas so it can comfortably swim again.</p><p>Also on the episode, we will meet Booger and Sampson (Bubbie is his preferred name), two double yellow-headed Amazon parrots who travel with their human mom, even visiting hotels and national parks.&nbsp; They are inseparable and clearly love their human mother.</p><p>Bubbie has a weird swollen and pink eye and Dr. Nixon will examine the bird to see what made Bubbie’s eye swell.</p><p>We will also meet Penny on the episode. The rabbit is having trouble having her second baby, which they have determined is likely in distress. The baby bunny fetus is not moving and does not want to come out. An emergency C-section may have to be performed to save Penny’s life.</p><p>Dr. T is quickly learning that each animal encounter is like being a detective, and she will even help a brave little gecko battling for its life after it was attacked by the family cat.</p><h2>Who is Dr. T?</h2><p>Dr. T, who was previously featured on the Nat Geo WILD show Dr. K’s Exotic Animal ER, runs a <a href=#>thriving practice in her home state of Texas</a>.
