  For the interior and corridor shots, the production crew used Burnaby Mountain Secondary School."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

These scenes come from several chools in the Vancouver area! The exterior shots of Riverdale High School are actually Lord Byng Secondary School in Vancouver. Turns out this is a pretty popular spot for films to shoot school scenes.

And as for the gymnasium where the Vixens train? That’s John Oliver Secondary School!</p><p>And remember the performances at Riverdale like Josie and the Pussycats and Carrie: The Musical? Those were all filmed at the auditorium at Point Grey Secondary School!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Host a pool party, “Riverdale” style</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/miami-villa-pool-neon-1024x683.webp><p>Remember the Riverdale Labor Day pool party in season three? Well, you can rent out the venue where they filmed it! The interior of the house and the pool itself are scenes shot at the Minnekhada Lodge in Coquitlam. You can rent out the lodge for $143 an hour for up to 50 people, according to the <a href=#>Metro Vancouver website.</a></p><p>Looking for something a bit more affordable to host your Riverdale themed pool party? <a href=#>Peerspace</a> has plenty of venues around the U.S. and Canada that might be a better fit for your budget — and just as gorgeous! On Peerspace, pool venues cost on average between $75-$200 an hour. Just go to the Peerspace <a href=#>outdoor event spaces page</a> and type in your location. Then, on the filters menu, scroll down until you find “pool.” From there you can check out what each venue has to offer!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Become part of the community at the real Riverdale Town Hall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/Urban-oasis-with-classic-Washington-dc-elegance-1024x683.jpg><p>The shots of Riverdale Town Hall in the “Riverdale” series are actually the bustling Fort Langley Community Hall in Langley, British Columbia! A visit to this spot is a must if you are in the area on the weekend because, as the<a href=#> community hall’s website says</a>, “it is a rare occasion to pass by the hall on a weekend, and see it unoccupied.” The community hall hosts the Cranberry Festival every year— which we think would be a perfect time to visit. The festival is usually in October with annual attendance of <a href=#>about 35,00 people</a>!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick stop at The Whyte Wyrm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/san-jose-country-bar-1-1024x683.jpg><p>Another must-visit spot for “Riverdale” fans while in Langley is the Whyte Wyrm — or as it has been known IRL, Gabby’s Country Cabaret. Unfortunately, <a href=#>Gabby’s closed in 2020</a> but you can still snap a pic outside! Hopefully, this property is brought back to life sometime soon — maybe even with a new name, say “The Whyte Wyrm”?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Take a dip In The Sweetwater River</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/Private-Hill-Country-Swimming-Hole-austin-rental-1024x683.jpg><p>One of the most picturesque spots in the “Riverdale” series is Sweetwater River, where Archie, Betty, and Jughead spent many a summer! But where is this beautiful spot in “Riverdale” filmed? Alouette Lake in Golden Ears Provincial Park! <a href=#>According to the British Columbia Parks website</a> you can enjoy many of the same activities the “Riverdale” cast did here and more! They say the lake is a perfect spot to enjoy the day swimming, windsurfing, waterskiing, canoeing, boating, and fishing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Discover the area’s history at The Riverdale Bus Station</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/austin-historic-train-station-1-1024x683.jpg><p>The Riverdale bus station in the series actually isn’t a bus station at all. It’s a museum (and former train station)! The Port Moody Station Museum is a great place to stop in for Riverdale fans and history buffs alike.</p><p>The station was built in 1908 and you can still visit the original building today. <a href=#>According to the Port Moody Museum website</a>, the museum also features a 1921 railcar, a World War 1 outdoor trench display, a meditation garden and a CP railway garden.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Season 4: The Motel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/palace-1024x683.jpg><p>And lastly, the motel from season four! IRL this hotel, known as the <a href=#>Pink Palace,</a> is no longer a functioning hotel but you can use it for film shoots. It’s just north of the U.S. border and includes access to over 150 hotel rooms for filmmakers — with no other guests on-site! It also includes 420 parking stalls, a pool, hot tub, restaurant, bar, and more. With so much room, it’s surprising they didn’t just shoot all the indoor Riverdale scenes in here!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJorqGdopp6qr%2BMq6CvnaKZrq2xjJ%2BgpaWVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
