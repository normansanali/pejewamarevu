1. I learned how to juggle while working on set because I was bored."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum, who partnered with <a href=#>Cascade</a> for its “Do It Every Night” campaign to raise awareness of the environmental friendliness of dishwashers, shares more.</p><p>1. I learned how to juggle while working on set because I was bored.</p><p>2. Getting six hours of sleep in a row is what excites me most.</p><p>3. I binge The Bachelor. It’s a little boring this season. Sorry, <a href=#><strong>Peter [Weber]</strong></a>, you seem very nice. I’m sure if there were windmills it’d be much more exciting.</p><p>4. I cry every day — I’m a parent!</p><p>5. My kids [Charlotte, 10, and Rocky, 7, with husband <a href=#><strong>Freddie Prinze Jr.</strong></a>] are the most influential people in my life. I love to see the world through their eyes, and [hear] the questions they ask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-0001.jpg><p>6. My go-to dish is anything with kale. My kids are obsessed. I could probably put ants on kale and they’d be like, “This is the best.”</p><p>7. My daughter’s playing volleyball, so I took a lesson with her. I’m actually pretty good. It hurts though. Take your rings off!</p><p>8. My first job was a commercial for Burger King.</p><p>9. The biggest misconception about me is that I’ve died twice.</p><p>10. My two go-to movies to watch on airplanes are Sixteen Candles and Soapdish.</p><p>11. I’d describe myself as empathetic and kind.</p><p>12. My biggest pet peeve is grammar [misuse] and when people say “so fun” or “anyways” — to me, that’s like nails on a chalkboard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-02-1.jpg><p>13. I can’t go to sleep with makeup on my face.</p><p>14. I wish I could play the piano.</p><p>15. My first car was a green Chrysler LeBaron convertible. I was taught you never get a car till the second season of a show. When we got the back order on the second season [of Buffy], I got rid of the car.</p><p>16. My biggest fear: anything [bad] happening to my kids.</p><p>17. [I think it’s weird] when you’re in the bathroom and people shove toilet paper underneath the stall and ask you to sign it.</p><p>18. If I weren’t an actress, I’d be <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> or <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a>. There are so many people I want to interview.</p><p>19. I love London.</p><p>20. John Kennedy Jr. was my celebrity crush. Wait, am I supposed to say Freddie?</p><p>21. The song I’m singing in the shower is whatever Broadway musical my daughter’s left in my head.</p><p>22. I would never jump out of an airplane.</p><p>23. I love so many books.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. My favorite lyric [from the song “No Contest,” from Chess]: “You taught me, baby/How the few who win acquire/What their hearts desire/It ain’t practice, it ain’t skill/They’ll help, but not as much as wanting will.” I think if you give up your real passion, all the talent in the world isn’t going to push you that extra mile.</p><p>25. I try really hard to get inspired by everyone around me. Whether it’s a business associate, another mom, my daughter — I think there’s so much to learn when you support other women.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWtW65yJyfnqScmnqosculmKtlYmp6tbTIp56sZamkwm6wzqerZqOepMRurcGorK1lnZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
