Woman in San Francisco stabbed while reciting Bible</strong></h3><p>In the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday, a disturbing incident unfolded when a man allegedly recited Bible verses while fatally stabbing a woman. The grim act was recorded and shared on Facebook, bringing it to the attention of the authorities, who took immediate action.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Nye County Sheriff’s Office in Nevada received the first report of the incident after a concerned caller saw the horrifying video online. Thanks to the footage, law enforcement was able to identify the suspect as 39-year-old Mark Mechikoff. Ryan Lenahan, who claimed to have known Mechikoff from childhood, was deeply disturbed by the video.</p><p>The victim, 41-year-old Claribel Estrella, was said to have some connection with Mechikoff, although the exact nature of their relationship remained unclear. As investigators delved into the motive behind the stabbing, Mechikoff was apprehended approximately 30 miles south of the San Mateo apartment complex where the lifeless body of Estrella was discovered.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The circumstances surrounding the crime were chilling. Mechikoff not only committed the brutal act but also heartlessly filmed the victim’s final moments before posting the video on Facebook. After the incident, he fled the area.</p><p>Following Mechikoff’s arrest, the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office charged him with one count of murder, with additional charges for causing severe bodily injury and using a knife. In court, he refrained from entering a plea, and his arraignment was postponed for a week to appoint a court-appointed attorney.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Authorities traced Mechikoff’s Facebook page to a large San Mateo apartment complex using his phone number. However, the profile and the disturbing video had already been taken down. After a thorough search of the complex, Estrella’s body was found inside a unit nearly three hours later. Mechikoff was arrested two hours later in San Jose.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The investigation into the motive and circumstances behind this tragic incident continues as the community grapples with the shock and grief caused by the senseless act of violence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdmLmivsibnKVllajBs7HLpZhmr5%2Birq95yKdkrJmeYrOzrc2coKybn2LAta3Bm5ydZaedtq2xjKucnKGknruoecGimaWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
