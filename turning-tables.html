Adele Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say moreI can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The first lines of the song, "Close enough to start a war, all that I have is on the floor" portrays the emotions of anger and frustration. Adele is upset with the intensity of the relationship, and it's causing her to feel like she's losing everything. "God only knows what we're fighting for, all that I say, you always say more," highlights the power dynamic in the relationship, where she feels that the other person has control over everything, and she's always left feeling helpless.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song, "I can't keep up with your turning tables, under your thumb, I can't breathe," showcases Adele's vulnerability, powerlessness, and frustration in the relationship. She feels like she's always trying to keep up and follow, and she's being suffocated and oppressed. However, in the second verse, she's resolved to take control of the situation, "Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior." She's acknowledging her strengths and is ready to stand up for herself and walk away from the toxic relationship.</p><br><p>Overall, "Turning Tables" is a powerful and emotional song that delves into the complexities of relationships. It talks about themes of power dynamics, control, and individual strength. The lyrics speak to anyone who has felt lost or suffocated in a relationship, and it's a reminder that sometimes it's essential to walk away and put yourself first.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Close enough to start a war</u><br>Our relationship is so precarious that any small action or conversation can lead to a conflict between us.</p><br><p><u>All that I have is on the floor</u><br>You have caused me so much distress that I am left with nothing but my emotions on the floor.</p><br><p><u>God only knows what we're fighting for</u><br>Our fights seem senseless and unclear, even to a divine power.</p><br><p><u>All that I say, you always say more</u><br>You always have a rebuttal or a criticism, no matter what I say.</p><br><p><u>I can't keep up with your turning tables</u><br>Your ever-changing moods and opinions confuse and exhaust me.</p><br><p><u>Under your thumb, I can't breathe</u><br>Your controlling nature suffocates me and takes away my autonomy.</p><br><p><u>So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me</u><br>I am putting up a protective barrier to prevent you from emotionally harming me again.</p><br><p><u>No, I won't rescue you to just desert me</u><br>I refuse to be your savior only to be discarded by you once again.</p><br><p><u>I can't give you the heart you think you gave me</u><br>You do not have the same emotional investment in this relationship as I do, and I cannot reciprocate your feelings.</p><br><p><u>It's time to say goodbye to turning tables</u><br>It's time to move on from this unstable cycle of conflict and repair in our relationship.</p><br><p><u>Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh</u><br>Even in the midst of my negative emotions, I still see you and the impact you have on me.</p><br><p><u>Where love is lost, your ghost is found</u><br>Even though our love is gone, the memory and effects of our relationship linger on.</p><br><p><u>I braved a hundred storms to leave you</u><br>It took an immense amount of effort and courage, but I finally left you and our relationship behind.</p><br><p><u>As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down</u><br>You may continue to try to emotionally manipulate me, but I won't let you break me down.</p><br><p><u>Next time I'll be braver</u><br>In the future, I will be courageous and assertive in my relationships.</p><br><p><u>I'll be my own savior</u><br>I will take control of my own life and be responsible for my own well-being.</p><br><p><u>When the thunder calls for me</u><br>When life presents unexpected challenges, I will be ready to meet them head-on.</p><br><p><u>Standing on my own two feet</u><br>I will be independent and self-sufficient, able to support myself without relying on anyone else.</p><br><p><u>Turning tables, yeah</u><br>Our relationship has been characterized by constant power shifts and emotional manipulation.</p><br><p><u>Turn, oh, no, no</u><br>I am refusing to participate in this cycle any longer, and I will not let you control my emotions or actions.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, CONCORD MUSIC PUBLISHING LLC, Downtown Music Publishing<br>Written by: Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, Ryan B.
