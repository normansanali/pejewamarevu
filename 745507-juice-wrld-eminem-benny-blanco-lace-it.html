Back in 2020, the legendary artists from Chicago and Missouri united (in a posthumous manner) for "Godzilla." That track calls <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Music To Be Murdered By</a> home. However, this single, fresh off the presses may we add, belongs to Juice and his team.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">All three have just come together for "Lace It," presumedly the second single from Jarad Higgins' last album, The Party Never Ends. According to the Genius page, there is also an unreleased song with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kid Cudi</a>, "All Life Long (Good Time)," that will land on it. There is no release date for the LP but is expected sometime next year. On the annotation for "Lace It," the single was supposed to be released on Friday, December 15. However, there were issues with the legal team.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-lace-it-by-juice-wrld-eminem-and-benny-blanco>Listen To "Lace It" By Juice WRLD, Eminem, And Benny Blanco</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Then, Juice's co-manager, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Bibby</a> sent this message out the same day of the initial drop date on Instagram. He said, "200 phone calls to get this song to y'all!! Hope you appreciate it cuz I hate talking that much….&nbsp;The Party Never Ends&nbsp;coming soon!! Big Thank you to Eminem and Benny on this one!! Let the Party Start." The song has nearly 100,000 views on YouTube in its first two hours and there is good reason for that. It is a very deep cut about struggling with drug addiction, which as we well know, took Juice's life at the young age of 21. Juice's final lyrics are very chilling and emotional but also have us excited for his last body of work. "Me? <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I can never ever die</a>, can never ever die."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new single, "Lace It," by Juice WRLD, Eminem, and benny blanco?
