It’s not supporting me being on the court,” Venus Williams said.</p><p>“It’s such a bummer, but I’m going to work on myself and get myself together to be at the US Open,” she said.</p><p>Five days after losing to Zheng Qinwen of China at the Western & Southern Open in Mason, Ohio, Williams had been slated to play her debut match in Cleveland on Monday.</p><p>She defeated No&nbsp;16 Veronika Kudermetova of Russia earlier in her run at&nbsp;the event just&nbsp;outside of Cincinnati, giving her her first victory over a top-20 opponent in four years. After missing nearly six months due to injury, Williams is ranked No&nbsp;407 in the world with a 3-6 record this season.</p><p>The 43-year-old tennis icon&nbsp;has been granted a wild card to the US Open, which starts on 28&nbsp;August.

Now 43, the former No. 1 missed nearly six months on the court due to injury this year, but made her return during the grass-court season. Never a player to be counted out, Williams clinched her first Top 20 win since 2019 two days ago at the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati, defeating Veronika Kudermetova in straight sets.</p><p>“Wozniacki, 33, is making her first Grand Slam appearance since retiring after the 2020 Australian Open to start a family. Now with two small children, 2-year-old Olivia and 6-month-old James, the former world No. 1 and 2018 Australian Open champion is returning to the courts where she was the women’s singles finalist in 2009 and 2014.”</p><p>READ MORE: <a href=#>How Serena Williams keeps sister Venus going on the WTA Tour</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGiurZldqby2vo6vnKeto2LEqrjLopimq12kwrV5zp9knKSVq7Ktrc2dZKKmo57Atb%2BMrJ%2BeZaeeua15z6WYsmWlqHqwvMSn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
