Other clients Rose has represented include Carmelo Anthony, Andrea Bargnani, Omri Casspi, Richard Hamilton, Chris Paul, J.R. Smith, Rodney Stuckey, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Renaldo Balkman, Mardy Collins, Eddy Curry, DeSagana Diop, Jonny Flynn, Eddie Jones, Dajuan Wagner, Kenny "Special K" Soll, and Jonas Valanciunas.</p><p>As of this writing, Leon has negotiated $1 billion in contracts throughout his career. He earned roughly $40 million personally in commissions in 2019 alone.</p><p>Salary Structure:&nbsp;Leon Rose earns a percentage-based salary depending on how much money he is able to secure for his clients. The average agent will earn anywhere from 15-20% of all money earned by an athlete. While rival Drew Rosenhaus has claimed that he only takes 3% of his NFL client's paydays, Leon's personal cut after expenses is likely around 4 or 5%. In return for these fees an agent typically hopes to bring the client at least 5x more money through his negotiation experience and leverage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmecmryvedGoqp5lnprBbsPOq6uhZWJshXKAlw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
