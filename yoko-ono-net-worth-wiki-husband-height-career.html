Relationship</span></h2><p>She enrolled at Gakushuin University but left for an unidentified reason after two semesters. After the war, she moved to the US and re-enrolled in a nearby college. Her parents didn’t like it, but she liked meeting famous singers and artists at college. Even their interest in her way of life was lacking.</p><p>Together with her real love, Toshi Ichiyanagi, she fled from college. She filed for divorce in 1962, and a diagnosis of severe depression was obtained the following year. After she had recovered from the recession, she wed musician Anthony Cox, but their union broke down in 1969. Although her second marriage did not immediately succeed, they stayed together for the sake of their infant daughter.</p><p>Cox won custody of their daughter as part of their divorce and soon withdrew from the public eye. In the interim, Ono wed John Lennon, and the two searched fruitlessly for her daughter. She later met her daughter in 1988.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Yoko_Ono_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Yoko Ono?
