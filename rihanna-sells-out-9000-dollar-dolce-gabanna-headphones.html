What was were the <a href=# data-injected=1>headphones</a> she was wearing: gold, jewel-encrusted headphones that resemble a tiara.</p><p>The image was retweeted over 160,000 times and received over 270,000 likes. It didn’t take long before the headphones, <a href=#>made by Dolce & Gabanna</a>, were tracked down. <a href=#>This particular pair sold for $9,000</a>, mostly due to the Swarovski crystals and other ornamentation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>This sparked an immediate interest in the brand, and especially the pair Rihanna was wearing. Within 24 hours of the tweet, the headphones had sold out, <a href=#>Digiday reports</a>. This is likely due in part to the hype surrounding the album, which had yet to be released at the time. Still, it’s easy to wonder exactly what type of buyer is going after this type of headphones.</p><p>Audiophiles and fashionistas alike probably recognize that Dolce & Gabanna isn’t a name you often see associated with headphones. The set was created in collaboration with Frends, an audio brand that exclusively focuses on women.</p><p>The sold-out set aren’t the only expensive headphones created as part of the collaboration between <a href=#>Frends and Dolce & Gabanna</a>. The Embellished Leather Headphones with various colors of fox fur are also available, and&nbsp;if you want to go easier on the wallet, the <a href=#>Embellished Red Leather Headphones are the cheapest in the line, selling for just $7,000</a>.</p><p>On the Frends website, the headphones Rihanna was <a href=#>responsible for selling out</a> only has one review, a one-star review at that. “Too heavy on the head and sound is not that great,” the review reads. “I’ll stick to my Beats by Dre.”</p><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfosK0tcJoqaKgkaO7onnSnqOlq12kwrV5mGlnaWWUpLmtrdFmm6ikk5p6qK3BmqWnmV2dsqKwz6Gmp52jZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
