They don’t flat-out tell you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how strong a character is or how powerful they can become.</a> However, they serve as a reliable indicator of their notoriety to the World Government and, by extension, how urgently they need to be apprehended and even eliminated.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>We’ve seen the Straw Hats <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">going from greenhorns to having one of the biggest fleets in the world</a>. They went from zeroes to (morally complex) heroes and even ascended to Emperors of the Sea. It’s an exciting ride that we’ve had the pleasure of seeing, and it is only becoming more adrenaline-inducing with their escalating bounties.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-bounties-and-how-are-they-chosen data-injectable=false><strong>What are bounties, and how are they chosen?&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bounties-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Bounties, as you probably know, refer to a substantial sum of money awarded to anyone who captures a specific individual. In the world of One Piece, these bounties are determined by the World Government, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reflecting the threat the individuals pose to the global regime</a>. Given that pirates are often considered the biggest threats to the government, they are typically the ones with assigned bounties. Some examples include:</p><ul data-current-count=136.5 data-injectable=false><li>Alvida- $5,000,000</li><li>Arlong- $20,000,000</li><li>Crocodile- $1,965,000,000</li><li>Gol D. Roger- $5,564,800,000</li></ul><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=626.5 data-injectable=true>When creating the bounties the bounties, creator Eiichiro Oda took into consideration the several reasons to increase a price — other than strength, that is. The World Government need to consider how much of a threat the pirates are and if they know any of the government secrets — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like Monkey D. Dragon</a>. Later on, they consider their feats, how destructive they are, and of course, the size of their fleet. On that note, let’s see how the Straw Hats’ bounty has changed after Wano.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Tony Tony Chopper — 1,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chopper-one-piece-wano.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 100 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>With a 900 berries raise, Chopper finally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got his wishful increase since Dressrosa</a>. Although Chopper has proven to be a formidable fighter over and over again, battling all opponents that crossed his path, he is oftentimes underestimated as the pet of the crew. However, his true strength lies in medical expertise. Slowly but surely, he has been addressing every health threat that comes his way, whether it involves healing a friend or a foe.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Nami — 366,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nami-one-piece-wano.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 66,000,000 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>Nami has had a significant growth since her initial bounty of 16 million berries. During the Dressrosa arc, the Straw Hats’ navigator saw an increase of 60 million berries after defeating the Doflamingo pirates. Following the events in Wano, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where Nami played a crucial role</a> in infiltrating Orochi’s castle, protecting Tama, facing off against the Tobiroppo, and ultimately challenging the strongest alliance in the world, her bounty reached its highest point yet, totaling 366 million berries.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Brook —</strong> <strong>383,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/brook-one-piece-wano.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 83,000,000 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>Formerly the musician and later the captain of the Rumbar Pirates, Brook already had an impressive bounty of 33 million berries. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after his first death</a>, Brook ended up joining the Straw Hats during the Thriller Bark arc, a staggering 50 years after his entire crew was tragically murdered. His bounty only increased during his time with the Straw Hats, reaching 83 million berries after Dressrosa and a remarkable 383 million after Wano.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Franky —</strong> <strong>394,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/franky-one-piece-wano.jpg><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 94,000,000 berries</strong></p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Franky, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">despite being an infamous figure known in Water 7</a>, did not earn his first bounty until he formed an alliance with the Straw Hats, receiving his first bounty of 44 million berries. This bounty saw an increase after Dressrosa, reaching 94 million berries. Similarly to the rest of his crewmates, the shipwright’s bounty skyrocketed even further after Wano, reaching an impressive 394 million berries.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>God Usopp — 500,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/usopp-one-piece-wano.jpg><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 200,000,000 berrie</strong></p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>Usopp has had an unconventional growth when it comes to his bounty. After Enies Lobby, Usopp — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">or better, Sogeking</a> — got a bounty of 30 million berries. While Sogeking served his purpose as the sniper of the crew during that time, it wouldn’t be until the events of Dressrosa that Usopp would finally get a bounty of 200 million berries to his name. Usopp’s bounty rose up to 500 million berries following the Wano infiltration and after defeating the Beast and Mom Pirates.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nico<strong> Robin —</strong> <strong>930,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/robin-one-piece-wano.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 130,000,000 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Earning a bounty of 79 million berries at just 8 years old, Robin’s reputation has spread throughout the World Government like wildfire. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As the sole survivor of Ohara Island</a>, Robin is the only person capable of reading the poneglyphs and deciphering the location of the one piece, making her a constant target of the Government.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>After the events at Enies Lobby, where she successfully escaped the clutches of Cipher Pol 9, Robin’s bounty increased to a total of 80 million berries. Following Dressrosa, her bounty rose again to 130 million berries. However, in Wano, upon defeating Black Maria and escaping CP0, she became the government’s primary threat once again with a bounty of 930 million berries.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Vinsmoke <strong>Sanji — 1,032,000,000 berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sanji-one-piece-wano.png><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 330,000,000 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>The fourth-largest bounty among the Straw Hats belongs to the crew’s cook, Sanji. In Dressrosa, Sanji’s bounty increased from 77 million to 177 million. However, his wanted poster has a unique feature—it explicitly states that he should only be captured alive.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>During Whole Cake Island, we discover that this is because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s a prince and a member of the Vinsmoke family</a>, leading to his bounty soaring to 330 million berries. The cook would surpass the billion mark after defeating Kaido’s left-hand, Queen, in Wano, earning a bounty of 1,032 billion berries on his head.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Jinbe —</strong> <strong>1,100,000,000 billion berries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jinbe-one-piece-wano.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Previous bounty: 438,000,000 berries</strong></h3><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Previously a member of the Sun pirates led by Fisher Tiger, Jinbe’s fame was already well known even before he joined the Straw Hats.

Starting with a modest sum of 30 million berries, Luffy’s bounty kept climbing. After Alabasta, it rose to 100 million berries, and following Enies Lobby, it surged to 300 million. In Dressrosa, upon defeating Doflamingo, it skyrocketed to 500 million.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Later in Whole Cake Island, Luffy defeated several captains of the Big Mom Pirates, earning him a bounty of 1.5 billion berries.
