I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy,” the Legally Blonde actress wrote on Instagram. “And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps. But we are doing it. … I have MS and I am ok. But if you see me, dropping crap all over the street, feel free to help me pick it up. It takes a whole day for me alone. Thank you and may we all know good days amongst the challenges.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/jamie-king.jpg><p>King told Us on Tuesday that is “really proud” of how open Blair has been about her journey “from the very beginning.”</p><p>“We’ve been through a lot with each other and I’m eternally grateful for her,” the model explained. “I will do whatever it takes as her best friend to make sure that anything that I can do to support that I will be there.”</p><p>King also spoke to Us about women’s health overall, including the benefits of CBD [a cannabis extract]&nbsp;and&nbsp;marijuana.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I came out here to support EMBER and I’m really interested in learning all that I can about this space. I don’t smoke cannabis, I don’t smoke marijuana, I don’t take CBD, but I am extraordinarily interested in women’s health,” she explained. “I think that we’re at a precipice right now where with enough funding, with enough research, we can start getting women options. Specifically if you have endometriosis or PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome], people with MS, people that have cancer, people that have epilepsy, there are really incredible studies that have been coming out that I think are deeply important.”</p><p>“People that are unable to eat when they are sick with cancer, when they have eating disorders, women that are suffering in pain all the time with endometriosis and PCOS, pubic inflammatory issues,” King continued. “It’s endless and so my main reason for being here is to learn everything that I can.”</p><p>With reporting by Kayley Stumpe&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZmism63yKeeZqeeYq%2Bmv9NmnauhlaOxbr%2FEpaSaZZKhrqq%2B0makrqSknr2tsYysmqWdoqTAqr%2BMnaCan56kwKq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
