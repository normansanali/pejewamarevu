Are sheep secretly Queen fans and we had no idea? Well, it turns out the barnyard buddies were able to listen to the song thanks to the Ridgeline’s truck-bed-audio system.

Honda hasn’t run a Super Bowl ad since 2014, back when it promoted safety with a commercial featuring <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bruce Willis</a></strong>, 60, and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fred Armisen</a></strong>, 49. Before that, Honda pretty much won the super bowl in 2012 when they had <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Matthew Broderick</a>,&nbsp;</strong>53, reprise his legendary Ferris Bueller character for a commercial.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This time around, there aren’t any celebrities in their ad, but that’s because Honda is looking at another successful Super Bowl brand.

They’re going up against commercials featuring <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lil Wayne</a></strong>, 33, getting patriotic, Death Wish coffee channeling the power of&nbsp;Vikings, and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan Reynolds</a></strong>, 39, playing football with himself. We’ll have to see what other commercials will air during the big game on Feb. 7.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Did you like this Honda ad, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
