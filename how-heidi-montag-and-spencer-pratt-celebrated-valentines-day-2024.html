You always do that.”</p><p>Pratt told his wife that when he’s gotten her flowers in the past “it was not worth the payoff,” but Montag disagreed.</p><p>“Yes, it was, I look at them all the time,” she continued. “Maybe I don’t have as much time to sit there. … You shouldn’t have an expectation about it because it means more than, obviously, I’m conveying.”</p><p>Their official podcast account later confirmed that Pratt “came thru” with roses for Montag by sharing a photo of the bouquet.</p><p>Montag and Pratt have been together since their days on <a href=#>The Hills</a>, the MTV reality show that premiered in 2006.

Dad eats healthy, let’s all eat healthy together,’” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> exclusively last month. “My mom says I have the healthiest kids of anyone she’s seen. I do try to [get] the healthiest foods for them. I obviously don’t want to deprive them of being children, so it’s all about balance for them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6ditaa1w6Jkpqeeqa6oecCnm2aroJq7pLHRZqermaSpeqSxy56Zq5mkmrFuwsClnKesmaOytHnDmrBmamBngXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
