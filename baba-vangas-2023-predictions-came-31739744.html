Some of these predictions include the election of an African American as the President of the United States, and Indira Gandhi's assassination in 1984, reports the Mirror.
Loyal followers of Baba Vanga have conveyed her predictions through writing, as she has never recorded them down. However, some of her supposed prophecies seemed to have come true for 2023 - but not all of them, though."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on below to find out more.</p><h3>What Baba Vanga got wrong</h3><h4>Designer babies</h4><p>The clairvoyant reportedly predicted the creation of "designer babies" that are grown in laboratories, with parents being able to select their physical traits.</p><p>In December last year, biotechnologist Hashem Al-Ghaili released a video that presented a lab that was reportedly able to "incubate up to 30,000 lab-grown babies per year".</p><p>This project, dubbed Ectolife, is yet to exist in the world, but those troubled by genetic engineering do have reason to be worried as the facility's as-of-yet hypothetical "Elite Package" allows parents to "edit any trait of [their] baby through a wide range of over 300 genes".</p><p>Baba's prediction, then, is worryingly plausible – but not quite correct.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top Trending Stories Today</h3><h4>Devesta<span></span>ting nuclear disaster</h4><p>Baba Vanga is also said to have predicted a major nuclear plant explosion this year, that would see toxic gas settle over Asia.</p><p>Thankfully, 2023 hasn't seen any such event – but with a month still to go, there is still time for a nuclear disaster similar to Chernobyl in 1986.</p><p>The climate crisis is also continuing to worsen, as "toxic clouds" - albeit not nuclear ones - are beginning to develop in some parts of Asia.</p><h3>What Baba Vanga got right</h3><h4>A calamitous solar storm</h4><p>Baba believed that a solar storm would rock the globe this year. A solar storm occurs when disturbances on the sun emit solar flares and large clouds of highly magnetised plasma, interfering with the Earth's own magnetic field.</p><p>And on December 1, State forecasters warned that a massive solar storm was due to hit Earth, causing radio, internet, and GPS fluctuations.</p><span class=factbox-header><h3>Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community!</h3></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article31220010.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_IMG_0001JPG.jpg><p>Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.</p><p>You'll receive daily updates on breaking news as well as the top headlines across Scotland.</p><p>No one will be able to see who is signed up and no one can send messages except the Daily Record team.</p><p>All you have to do is <a href=# rel=nofollow><b>click here if you're on mobile</b></a>, select 'Join Community' and you're in!</p><p>If you're on a desktop, simply scan the QR code above with your phone and click 'Join Community'.</p><p>We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.
