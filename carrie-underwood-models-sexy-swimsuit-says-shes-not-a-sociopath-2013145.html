The 30-year-old country music superstar covers the June issue of <a href=#>Marie Claire</a> and models an eye-catching $1,195 Burberry Prorsum swimsuit in the accompanying photo spread. Speaking to contributor <strong>Allison</strong> <strong>Glock</strong>, the Oklahoma native opens up about her upbringing and her future with husband <strong>Mike Fisher</strong>.</p><p>“I’m not a mushy person at all. We were never a huggy family. Or a ‘let’s talk it out’ family. Technically I have siblings, but they are quite a bit older than me. I was the accident, so I have the only-child syndrome going on,” Underwood admits. “I’m a little more selfish, a little more independent, a little closed. I do wish I were softer. I wish I were able to form relationships better. But hey, I mean, I’m not a sociopath.”</p><p>After Underwood was crowned an American Idol in 2005, the soft-spoken star’s world changed overnight. “At the beginning of my career, I used to have panic attacks. People were touching me, screaming ­– it made me really nervous. In public, I just get nervous. It’s a physical reaction, feeling like the walls are closing in,” she explains. “The fans are great. It’s not their fault. I don’t ever want to come across as ungrateful. But on my end, it is hard for me to process. Because I am still just me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The singer adds that her hockey player husband calls her “the queen of awkward moments. Anything that can be made awkward, I will make it awkward.” When the topic of kids comes up, Underwood admits she’s not ready to start a family with Fisher, 32. “I don’t feel old enough to have kids,” she says. “I know I am mature. But being responsible for another human?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>VIDEO: Get Carrie Underwood’s gorgeous date night hairstyle</p><p>Underwood always knew she was destined for stardom, but she had no idea how quickly it would come. In her high school yearbook, she listed a series of goals she wanted to achieve before her class reunion. “You were supposed to say what you would be doing in 10 years, and I said, ‘I will be rich, famous, and married to a hot guy,'” Underwood tells <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>. “I guess I should have added a few more things!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKntqZ51KebnqqnpLylecyom56ko2LApsTYZqqwoZ2owqrAjKyYsqtdqLWmv4ynpq1lkWLAsK%2FIqKearJhif3F9kmprbmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
