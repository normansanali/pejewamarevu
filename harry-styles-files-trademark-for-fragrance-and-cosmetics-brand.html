From his black and teal color-blocked mani at the 2019 Met Gala to the mixed fruit manicure that gave a special ode to “Watermelon Sugar,” “Cherry,” and “Sunflower, Vol. 6,” there’s no question Styles is quite stylish.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>That in mind, we’re pretty confident that his beauty brand, whatever it may include, is going to be all kinds of amazing.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52us77YZqqtsZyawG6yyKWcrGWkp66lscyaqaRllqS%2FbrLRmp6rmZ6Ysm6tzZ1knKejorK1tcKsZJuqkaOxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
