He trained me when I was very young, at Polytechnic High School.</p><p>“He got the part as my sidekick. Then Ana ‘Lollipop’ Sánchez got the other part and we became Electro Rock—the rivals. I had never had lines in a production before, plus I was really bashful. They told me just play the opposite of my character, so I went in and did it: ‘Hey punk! Are you back for more, fool?’”</p><p></p><p>In addition to Breakin’, Pop ‘N Taco also appeared in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey in 1991, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo&nbsp;and the 2009 documentary&nbsp;Michael Jackson Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour.
