But it's in danger of ruin, as a new airport would bring in loads more tourists.PixabayMachu Picchu was built in the 1400s for Incan emperor Pachacuti, historians believe.
The Incan citadel of Machu Picchu in Peru is one of the world’s most stunning pieces of engineering, and a hypnotizing, historical remnant of a mystical past.
Nestled in the Andes at around 8,000 feet, the government is now planning to boost the lucrative tourism it draws annually even more — by building a multibillion-dollar international airport nearby, which critics are adamant “would destroy it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The tiny town of Chinchero is reportedly hurrying to build new houses and hotels in anticipation of the incoming flood of tourists.</p><p>But for critics — who seem to have nothing but the sanctity and protection of this 15th-century site in mind — there are far more important matters at hand. This area was once home to the world’s largest empire, and jeopardizing its integrity for profit is simply unacceptable to countless academics.</p><p>“It seems ironic and in a way contradictory that here, just 20 minutes from the Sacred Valley, the nucleus of the Inca culture, they want to build an airport — right on top of exactly what the tourists have come here to see,” said Pablo Del Valle, a Cusco-based anthropologist.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219163 alt=Ollantaytambo width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ollantaytambo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-219163 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The 134-square-mile town and archaeological park of Ollantaytambo.

The petition, which Majluf took upon herself to start, asks Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra to re-assess this project — or choose a different spot.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s any significant archaeologist or historian working in the Cusco area that hasn’t signed the petition,” said Majluf.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219165 alt="Ollantaytambo Storehouses" width=900 height=514 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ollantaytambo-storehouses.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-219165 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Incas built storehouses at high altitudes in order to preserve their grain better. It’s theorized that grain was tipped in the uphill window, and retrieved from the downhill window. These were called Pinkuyllunas.</span></p><p>Chinchero was built as a royal estate for Incan ruler Túpac Inca Yupanqui, about 600 years ago. The area is extremely well-preserved, and offers an unquantifiable wealth of direct contact with a time long gone. Many of the structures in Machu Picchu befuddle archaeologists to this day.</p><p>The economy here is largely dependent on tourism and farming. As such, it’d be surprising if those desperate for more customers would oppose a big modern airport next door — but they do.</p><p>Alejandrina Contreras a blanket-weaver who lives in Chincero, said, “We live peacefully here, there are no thieves, there are no criminals. There will be progress with the airport but a lot of things will change.”</p><p>“Think of the noise, the air pollution, the illnesses it will bring,” said 20-year-old Karen Auccapuma.</p><p>This project has actually already been delayed, as the private company who had the winning bid became entangled in price-hike and corruption allegations. Unfortunately, arbitration on the current business model has been settled — and the government is eager to complete construction by 2023.</p><p>“This airport will be built as soon as possible because it’s very necessary for the city of Cusco,” Carlos Oliva, Peru’s finance minister, suggested. “There’s a series of technical studies which support this airport’s construction.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219172 alt="Machu Picchu Llama" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/machu-picchu-llama.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-219172 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A huge portion of the economy depends on tourism and farming, though many are opposed to the airport despite the economic benefits.</span></p><p>Naturally, there is local appeal for the project. Citizens have been regaled with the promise of 2,500 construction jobs, while the local land has increased in value so much that some have begun selling their properties for a pretty penny. Peasant families have changed their lives by selling farmland. Cusco Mayor Luis Cusicuna claimed local leaders have been desperate for a second, larger airport for decades.</p><p>The Incan site is “so singularly dominant for the Peruvian tourism offering,” said Mark Rice, author of Making Machu Picchu: The Politics of Tourism in Twentieth-Century Peru. “The best way I can describe it is if people going to Britain only went to Stonehenge.”</p><p>Rice explained that there’s “legitimate concern that Cusco’s travel infrastructure is at its limit,” however. So while the proposal has a rational backbone — in terms of business, at least — it most definitely will cause a “lot of damage to one of the key tourism offerings of Cusco, which is its scenic beauty.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219175 alt="Machu Picchu Terrace Steps" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/machu-picchu-terrace-steps.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-219175 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The world-famous terrace steps at Machu Picchu were used for farming.

In response, Peru narrowed entry requirements, such as limiting visits to certain times of day.</p><p>At this very moment, however, the nascent airport project is causing new houses, hotels, and buildings to be constructed in the area. Everyone is preparing to make this a lucrative endeavor, while throwing caution to the Incan wind.</p><p>The petition against this project can be found <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>After learning about the outrage Machu Picchu Airport is causing among historians, learn some key <a href=#>facts about Machu Picchu, Peru’s lost city</a>.
