After approximately 63 million viewers tuned in to the runaway hit series produced by Shonda Rhimes for Netflix, fans were quick to speculate that there may be something more between the series' two burgeoning stars, Regé-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor.

We did a lot of rehearsing. I think the thing that actually really helped the chemistry was all the dance rehearsals, because we just spent so much time with our choreographer, Jack Murphy, and loads of time in the studio—just me, Regé, and Jack sort of getting the moves right and dancing and dancing to this modern, fun music. And we just got time to play and sort of form a connection. I think that was so beneficial actually in getting the chemistry right," Dynevor told BAZAAR.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"And then, we have an intimacy coordinator," she continued. "So, we blocked and rehearsed all the intimacy scenes weeks and weeks before we started to do things. By the time we got to set, we knew what we were doing. We felt really comfortable. We knew each other, we'd already formed that relationship. We were very lucky to have all that time."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
