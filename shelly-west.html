Shelly West Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Well it's Sunday Mornin'
And the sun in shinin'
In my eye that is open
And my head is spinnin'
Was the life of the party
I can't stop grinnin'
I had to much Tequila last night
Jose Cuervo you are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The song tells the story of a woman who wakes up with a hangover after a wild night of partying and drinking tequila with salt and lime, courtesy of her friend Jose Cuervo. She is struggling to piece together the events of the previous night and wonders if she kissed all the cowboys, started a fight or danced on the bar.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, the singer's memory is hazy, and the events of the previous night are foggy. She is surprised to find a cute cowboy sleeping beside her and struggles to remember how she got his shirt on, all of which suggests that she had a wild night that was fueled by her love of tequila.</p><br><p>The song cleverly captures the feeling of being hungover and trying to piece together what happened the previous night. It also highlights the powerful and sometimes humorous effects of tequila on people. Overall, "Jose Cuervo" is a fun, lighthearted song that is perfect for a night out with friends or a karaoke session.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Well it's Sunday Mornin'</u><br>It's currently a Sunday morning.</p><br><p><u>And the sun in shinin'</u><br>The sun is shining brightly.</p><br><p><u>In my eye that is open</u><br>The sun is shining into one of my eyes that is open.</p><br><p><u>And my head is spinnin'</u><br>I'm experiencing dizziness.</p><br><p><u>Was the life of the party</u><br>I was the center of attention at a party.</p><br><p><u>I can't stop grinnin'</u><br>I'm unable to stop smiling.</p><br><p><u>I had to much Tequila last night</u><br>I consumed an excessive amount of Tequila the night before.</p><br><p><u>Jose Cuervo you are a friend of mine</u><br>Jose Cuervo Tequila is a reliable companion of mine.</p><br><p><u>I like to drink you with a little salt and lime</u><br>I prefer to consume Jose Cuervo Tequila with a garnish of salt and lime.</p><br><p><u>Did I kiss all the cowboys?</u><br>Did I engage in amorous activity with all the male attendees dressed as cowboys?</p><br><p><u>Did I shoot out the lights?</u><br>Did I discharge a firearm in the direction of lighting fixtures?</p><br><p><u>Did I dance on the bar?</u><br>Did I perform dance moves atop the establishment's bar?</p><br><p><u>Did I start a fight?</u><br>Did I initiate physical confrontation with another individual?</p><br><p><u>Now wait a minute</u><br>Hold on a moment.</p><br><p><u>Things don't look to familiar</u><br>I don't recognize my current surroundings.</p><br><p><u>Who is this cowboy</u><br>There is a male individual present, dressed as a cowboy, that I do not recognize.</p><br><p><u>Who's sleepin' beside me?</u><br>This unknown individual is slumbering right next to me.</p><br><p><u>He's awful cute, but how'd I</u><br>This person is quite attractive, but I'm unsure how I</p><br><p><u>Get his shirt on?</u><br>Wound up wearing his clothing.</p><br><p><u>All those little shooters</u><br>I enjoy drinking small amounts of Tequila.</p><br><p><u>How I love to drink 'em down</u><br>I really enjoy imbibing these drinks.</p><br><p><u>Come on bartender</u><br>Requesting bar staff to prepare another drink.</p><br><p><u>Let's have another round [Modulates]</u><br>Let's drink another round of Tequila.</p><br><p><u>Well the music is playing</u><br>There is currently music being played.</p><br><p><u>And my spirits are high</u><br>I'm feeling euphoric and excited.</p><br><p><u>Tomorrow might be painful</u><br>There is a likelihood of feeling unwell tomorrow.</p><br><p><u>But tonight we're gonna fly</u><br>Tonight we're going to have a great time.</p><br><p><u>Every time we get together</u><br>Whenever I consume Jose Cuervo Tequila.</p><br><p><u>I sure have a good time</u><br>I truly have an enjoyable experience.</p><br><p><u>You're my friend</u><br>Referring to Jose Cuervo Tequila as a friend.</p><br><p><u>You're the best</u><br>Jose Cuervo Tequila is the highest quality.</p><br><p><u>Mi amigo</u><br>Addressing Jose Cuervo Tequila as a good friend.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: CINDY JORDAN</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIuYmrmtxb6QnKysX3%2B8tLG%2BfKyeqqak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
