She frequently posts endorsing certain companies, and with a whopping 3.7 million followers, those posts probably don’t come cheap. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a> reports that the real estate mogul makes approximately $10,000 dollars per Instagram post. That sum also doesn’t include any videos, stories, or reels she may cook up on behalf of brands like T.J. Maxx and DSW.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Before she was reality — and realty — royalty, Stause had an acting career. She was a soap opera actress on All My Children, Days of Our Lives, and The Young and the Restless, which equated to hundreds of episodes of television. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> reports that soap actors like Stause can make anywhere from $450 to $1,000 per episode of a soap opera. Since she appeared on roughly 800 episodes of TV in her acting days, well, you do the math. That’s a lot of work and a lot of money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Selling_Sunset.jpg><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>We can’t forget her most recent and famous role as a realtor extraordinaire and drama fire-fighter on Selling Sunset on Netflix. She makes a pretty hefty commission on each of the houses that she sells, some of them even getting up to the $10 million range. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro</a>, the women on Selling Sunset make a 2.5% commission on the houses they sell. Two percent of multimillion-dollar homes isn’t too bad of a deal.</p><h2 id=h-so-how-much-is-chrishell-stause-worth data-injectable=false>So how much is Chrishell Stause worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Not only does she sell luxury homes, but she owns one, too.
