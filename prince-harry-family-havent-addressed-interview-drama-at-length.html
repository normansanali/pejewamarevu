Prince Harry is back in California after returning to the U.K. for Prince Philip’s funeral, but he didn’t get much closure with his family.
Though Harry, 36, had the chance to meet privately with Queen Elizabeth II, there were no opportunities for lengthy discussions about the drama kicked up by his bombshell interview with Meghan Markle, Harper’s Bazaar reports.
According to royal expert Omid Scobie, who wrote the piece, the Duke of Sussex and his family focused on coming together to mourn Philip, who was laid to rest on Saturday, April 17, after dying on April 9 at the age of 99."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think Harry was doing his best to say, ‘Hey, you know, bro, we’re still here. I’m still here. I still love you.’ And I believe William did his best to open his body language toward his brother.”</p><p>For now, Harry is happy to be back in the U.S. with <a href=#>Archie</a>, 23 months, and Markle, 39, who couldn’t travel for the funeral because of <a href=#>her pregnancy</a>. “Harry couldn’t wait to return to his heavily pregnant wife and Archie, and is happy to be back in Montecito,” the source added.</p><p>The couple also have a major task ahead of them: <a href=#>choosing a name</a> for their newest family member. “[They] have not settled on one yet,” an insider told Us, adding that they want the name “to have meaning” so they’re taking their time choosing. “There are some top picks for names but nothing concrete.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7Fdm66utcuyZKGZppq7tXnAnZurnaOosqV5yKernqqmnrK4ecOrmKaZXZbBbrjEp56toF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
