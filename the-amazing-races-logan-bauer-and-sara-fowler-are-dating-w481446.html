Two months after filming wrapped on the round-the-world competition, she and fellow contestant <b>Logan Bauer</b> connected during an October cast reunion.</p><p>The 27-year-olds — who weren’t partnered in the CBS reality show — had flirted during filming. “We were focused on the race, but definitely attracted to one another,” Fowler tells <i>Us</i> <i>Weekly</i>. So when their fellow cast members planned a camping trip to Joshua Tree National Park, they decided to make the 130-mile journey from L.A. to the southeastern California site together.</p><p>“It was only supposed to take three hours and we ended up sitting in traffic for seven,” says Baltimore native Fowler. “That’s kind of where things started to evolve.”</p><p>A November cast get-together in Chicago solidified the romance. “We hadn’t seen each other for a month and we didn’t skip a beat almost,” says Bauer, “which told us both there was something special there.” Adds Fowler, “We were both just blown away. It was surreal.”</p><p><a href=#>Merry Christmas</a></p><p>A post shared by Logan Bauer (@loganbauer) on Dec 11, 2016 at 6:44am PST</p><span class=caption></span><p>By December the pair were inseparable. After a vacation in the Virgin Islands, where Fowler once lived, they traveled to Georgia to spend the holidays with Bauer’s family. “We kind of blindsided them!” he jokes.</p><p>And the long-distance pair (he’s in Georgia; she’s in L.A.) envision many shared holidays in their future. “I think this is the first time both of us have been able to recognize the same exact wants and needs in another person and be able to actually deliver on those things,” says Bauer, who works in medical device sales. “We’re very willing to do anything for the other person.”</p><p>With their strong foundation the travel-loving couple — who recently got a dog they named Philomeena, a tribute to show host <b>Phil Keoghan</b> — expect to go the distance. Hints Bauer, “I think the next few logical steps are, without question, going to happen very soon.”</p><p>For more on this new pair — and other celebrity couples — pick up the new issue of <i>Us Weekly</i>, on stands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVirq6t2aKloGWilrCmv4ylpqCZnmKvosHEq2SappRiwKK%2BwGadqK%2Bcmr9urdGeZJ2ZpJ67qHnWbW9qbGRrfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
