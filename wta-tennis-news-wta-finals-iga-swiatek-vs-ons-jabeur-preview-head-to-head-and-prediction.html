Some of the top single-ranked players in the women’s circuit, who have performed really well this season, have participated in the WTA Finals. The roaster includes the likes of the 4-time singles Grand Slam champion, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Iga Świątek</a>, who has had a great start to the season-ending championship.</p><p>The 6th-seeded Ons Jabeur will now be the next opponent for the Polish tennis player in another crucial match of the hard court event. Both the WTA superstars are in excellent form and are quite familiar with one another’s game styles, so it should be an interesting watch.</p><p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Iga Świątek vs. Ons Jabeur: Group stage match preview</h2></p><p>The 22-year-old, who has enjoyed five triumphant runs this season, is off to a great start at the round-robin event in Cancun. As the second seed going into the competition, the Pole breezed past <strong>Markéta Vondroušová</strong>, 7-6, 6-0, despite the difficult challenge at hand. Afterward, Iga Świątek defeated <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Coco Gauff</a>, the recently crowned Grand Slam champion, 6-0, 7-5, to secure yet another easy group stage victory.</p><p>Ons Jabeur, on the other hand, failed to start her campaign in Cancun on a high note as she was thumped in the very first match. The Tunisian tennis player’s young American colleague, Gauff, swept aside her in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1. However, the 29-year-old later made amends as she overcame Markéta Vondroušová, who has now failed to secure a place in the semifinals.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Iga Świątek vs. Ons Jabeur: Head-to-Head Record</h2><p>When it comes to their head-to-head record, the Pole leads 4-2, as she will now square off against Jabeur for the seventh time on the tour. Iga Świątek and Ons Jabeur previously met at this season’s Stuttgart Open, where the former was given a walkover just after the third set.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-wta-tennis-news-tennis-beauty-paula-badosas-bold-and-courageous-photo-sparks-sizzling-reactions-from-boyfriend-coco-gauff-and-aryna-sabalenka?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1019158052h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Tennis Beauty Paula Badosa’s Bold and Courageous Photo Sparks Sizzling Reactions From Boyfriend, Coco Gauff, and Aryna Sabalenka</p></a><p>Prior to this, the WTA players also confronted each other in a Grand Slam encounter in New York, where Świątek once again enjoyed a straight-set win, 6-2, 7-6. However, in the 2021 Wimbledon Championships, it was the Tunisian who prevailed in a three-set nail-biter against her young rival.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Prediction: Iga Świątek to secure yet another victory</h2><p>The 22-year-old, who is currently on a seven-match win streak, will look to continue her great on-court momentum in Cancun. In doing so, the Pole will also defeat the sixth seed, Jabeur, and will further comfortably move to the semifinals of the round-robin tournament.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY |&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Serena Williams pays tribute to Roger Federer.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9atmGaslaO7qr%2BMp5ywq12swaJ5xaKlmqSjYraorYysrqKZpJq4bsLSZqanq12frqOx1KtkqaqVq7amw4yhnJqcXam8brTEmptmmZ6ZerG%2BxJ2gnKyZpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
