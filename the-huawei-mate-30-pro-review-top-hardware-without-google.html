This is 5% larger than its predecessor, and the new phone also comes with a new more efficient SoC. The question of how the new phone will end up in the battery charts is largely dependent on how its new screen will behave, and if it’s going to be nearly as efficient as some of the new generation Samsung panels we’ve seen employed in the new Galaxy and iPhones this year.</p><p><img alt="Web Browsing Battery Life 2016 (WiFi)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15099/96171.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Starting off with the web browsing test, we do see the Mate 30 Pro edge out the Mate 20 Pro by 18% and achieving a good battery life result of 11.75 hours. While in absolute terms of a good result, it doesn’t manage to keep up with the more efficient devices from Samsung and Apple. Whilst the Mate 30 Pro has a good base power consumption of ~420mW, the screen panel’s luminosity efficiency doesn’t seem to have improved much compared to last year’s model, and this results in the Mate 30 Pro falling behind even though it has a bigger battery and more efficient SoC.</p><p><img alt="PCMark Work 2.0 - Battery Life" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph15099/96172.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>PCMark is more a heavier compute workload which puts more stress on the SoC and less on the display panel due to the lower APL, and here the Mate 30 Pro actually fares very well, landing in as amongst the most efficient devices. Keeping in mind that the performance exhibited here is excellent, the Kirin 990 does really make the phone shine.</p><p>The overall conclusion for battery life is that there’s two aspects to the phone. The phone itself is extremely efficient and sports a very large battery, however it’s hampered by a quite inefficient screen. This is a scenario where battery life will differ a lot depending on how you use your phone – if you’re the type of person using it outside at maximum brightness a lot of times, then the Mate 30 Pro won’t fare as well as the competition. If you’re using it more extensively at lower brightness levels, the inefficiency of the display will impact battery life less and here the phone’s excellent internal hardware will outpace other devices by greater margins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52fJhyZq2glWK1tq3WnqBmpZGpsm5%2Fj2anq6ddp7K3tcSwZK2noGK1or7DsJirnV2strW0zq6rZp%2BfpLStsY5v</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
