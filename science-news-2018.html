Researchers have long puzzled what exactly happened and why.</p><p>Now, almost 500 years later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there may be an answer</a>.</p><p>The locals described the disease as “cocoliztli,” which means pestilence in the Aztec Nahuatl language. Using DNA evidence from the teeth of long-dead victims, scientists were able to instead conclude that the cause of the pestilence was likely a typhoid-like “enteric fever” caused by Salmonella enterica, specifically a subspecies known as Paratyphi C, similar to Salmonella.</p><p>Researchers based this finding on the analysis of DNA from 29 skeletons found in a cocoliztli cemetery. However, the team stated that there could have been other pathogens present that were either undetectable or unknown.</p><p>In addition to the cause of the pestilence, the study also claims to have found its origins: European colonizers. The most likely scenario is that animals carrying the Paratyphi C. pathogen were brought to Mexico by settlers, whose immune systems were already equipped to handle the germ. The Aztecs, however, who had never been exposed to such a disease, were not able to handle the deadly consequences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0r8iepZydXaOyuL%2BMa2dqcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
