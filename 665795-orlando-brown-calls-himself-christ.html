Many were concerned about his behavior and have been for years now. Then, late last year, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he was arrested for</a> "aggravated menacing." He was said to be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">going through a mental evaluation after the arrest</a>. This was not the first time Brown was arrested for reasons relating to violence. Back in 2018, the actor did an interview with Dr. Phil, where he admitted to substance abuse struggled. “A lot of drinking is what happened,” Brown said at the time. “I was drinking a lot. I just found myself in a dark place because I couldn’t really find everybody... From there, now I’m good.” Whether or not he really is good is anybody's guess.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Orlando Brown is an actor, rapper, and singer that is most recognizable for his acting roles on kid-friendly sitcoms. Brown began his acting career in the late 1990s, with roles in television shows such as Family Matters and Moesha. However, he is perhaps best known for his role as Eddie Thomas on the Disney Channel sitcom That's So Raven. Brown also pursued a career in music, releasing an album in 2006 titled Trade It All. In recent years, Brown has gained attention for his personal struggles, including legal issues and mental health challenges. Despite these challenges, he has continued to pursue his career, appearing in various projects, including the 2021 film Trafficked: A Parent's Worst Nightmare.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-orlando-is-just-fine-without-raven>Orlando Is Just Fine Without Raven</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Orlando Brown has made more concerning comments in a new red carpet interview. The actor was walking the carpet for the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">premiere of the Zeus Network show Bad Boys Texas</a>. In a previously-released clip from the show, Brown made some claims about making noodles in the same toilet he peed in. That was disturbing enough, but the actor's interview on the red carpet premiere of the show has also raised some red flags with many. It is worth noting that his publicist was standing very close behind him the entire time, looking a little more worried than any publicist ever should.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the interview, Brown is asked about Disney reboots. He tells the interviewer he doesn't care about the shows. Then, directly referencing the show he became famous for, That's So Raven, Brown makes it clear that he and the titular star are on two separate paths. "Raven's doing her sh*t. I love that sh*t," he said. "I'm doing my sh*t. She loves that sh*t. We all loving our sh*t." The interviewer then asks what Brown's relationship with Jesus Christ was. He quickly replies, "I am Christ." With that, the interview was over. What do you think of Orlando Brown's new comments?
