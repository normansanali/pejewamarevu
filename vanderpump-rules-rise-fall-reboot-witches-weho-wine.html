Thanks to its ups and downs, there has always been a saga element to this wine company.

The three reality TV stars first launched the Witches of WeHo's Basic Witch Potion #1 Pinot Grigio, as well as a rosé. However, in June 2020, the wine line was pulled. This happened around the same time that Stassi and Kristen were fired over a scandal. The controversy involved false accusations about a co-star, Faith Stowers.</p><h2 id=when-did-witches-of-weho-wine-launch>When Did Witches Of WeHo Wine Launch?</h2><p>During the early days of Vanderpump Rules, Stassi, Kristen, and Katie were not only servers at SUR - they were best friends. The 20-something gal pals were the main (and sometimes mean) "girl group" at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant. They liked to think they called the shots. The three stars enjoyed pushing around a young Scheana Shay, and gave their clique a unique name. That's how The Witches of WeHo group was born. They rode bikes around their neighborhood, instead of broomsticks.</p><h2 id=why-the-vanderpump-rules-wine-brand-was-so-controversial>Why The Vanderpump Rules Wine Brand Was So Controversial</h2><p>As stated above, after it was revealed that Stassi and Kristen had made insensitive racial remarks about Faith, the wine line was pulled from shelves. At the time, a representative from Nocking Point (the company that manufactured the wine) said it would no longer be <a href=#>producing the Vanderpump Rules elixir</a>. The wine manufacturer also released a statement via<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Us Weekly</a>, part of which said that the firm stood, "squarely against the systemic oppression."</p><h2 id=are-the-quot-witches-quot-cashing-in-on-the-scandoval>Are The "Witches" Cashing In On The Scandoval?</h2><p>A little more than a month after the <a href=#>news broke regarding Tom Sandoval</a> cheating on Ariana Madix, The Witches of WeHo wine made its return to stores. This time, Stassi has bowed out of the venture, with Kristen and Katie taking the reins. <strong>Vanderpump Rules</strong> fans can buy two bottles for $44 at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nocking Point</a> website. The secret ingredient for this witch's brew happens to be, "The tears of your exes!"</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nocking Point</a></p>Related Topics About The Author<h3 class=section-title>Recommended Articles</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunDCwKebnqqgqrqxedGuo56rXae2tLGMn5ilpF2nsqO7zq1ksKGkmLWmv4ywnKGnXay2r7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
