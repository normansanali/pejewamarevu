(Walden is Kutcher's character on the show; Kate is played by <strong>Brooke D'Orsay</strong>.)</p><p>Within the episode were tons of references to Kutcher and Kunis' real-life relationship, as well as their history as costars on That '70s Show. There was even a brief shot of the real-life bride-to-be, 30, in — wait for it — a wedding dress! Here are the five best moments and inside jokes:</p><p>1. After Vivian introduces herself, Walden compliments her "beautiful" name. "Thank you. My parents got it from that '70s show," she replies, in a cheeky nod to Kunis and Kutcher's former series. "What was it called? Oh, Maude!"&nbsp;</p><p>2. Walden invites Vivian to stay the night so she doesn't have to camp outside in the rain. "It's just a little water," she says. "I'm not gonna melt. It's not like I'm the Wicked Witch of the West." (Kunis played the Wicked Witch in 2013's Oz The Great and Powerful.)</p><p>3. Over Chinese takeout, Vivian tells Walden he seems like the kind of guy who only dates hot actresses. "God, no," he quips. "I'd never date an actress. They're all crazy."</p><p>"I don't get this whole fascination with celebrities anyway," she jokes. "Who cares who's dating whom, or who's engaged to who, or who has a sex tape that no one will ever, ever see?"</p><p>"I know. But I have to say — I am a sucker for anything having to do with a Brangelina or a Kimye," Walden admits, prompting Vivian to say, "I have no idea what that means. I thought we were eating Kimye."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>4. Right before Vivian leaves, Walden has a moment in which he imagines her in a wedding dress. (For the record, Kunis is going to make a beautiful bride!) When she asks if he's going to be okay, he replies dazedly, "I do…think I'm gonna be okay."</p><p>5. After reuniting with his would-be fiancee, Kate, Walden runs off to profess his love to Vivian, who is camping in the woods. "Before I met you, I was very close to asking another woman to marry me. But then I didn't, because I couldn't stop thinking about you," he tells her, somewhat goofily. "We're soul mates." (All together now: Aw!)?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSipJFiuLa6yKxkra%2BfYq6vsIyaZKGZnJt6rrHNZpypoaOksaZ5wKyfraeeYri2wMKhnKtlkprAtXnMqKSepqSoenN8kG1oaWxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
