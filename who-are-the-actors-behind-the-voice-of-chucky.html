Over the course of Chucky's on-screen reign, there have been an array of actors behind the voice that has sent chills down many spines, most of which have appeared alongside <a href=#>Jennifer Tilley</a>, but who exactly are the faces of the famed horror doll? Let's find out!</p><h2 id=brad-dourif-voiced-chucky-in-39-child-39-s-play-39>Brad Dourif Voiced Chucky In 'Child's Play'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the Child's Play franchise, it was none other than Brad Dourif who took on the role of Chucky for the first few films. Dourif definitely managed to portray Chucky as creepily as possible and considering the fear that is still instilled amongst viewers from the original 1988 film is very much alive, it's clear he did a stellar job.</p><p>The actor is also no stranger to voicing horror characters, as he's also portrayed the Gemini Killer in The Exorcist III back in 1990, and his portrayals in Death Machine (1994), and Alien Resurrection (1997). Luckily for hardcore Chucky fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Dourif will be reprising his role</a> of Chucky, voicing the doll in the upcoming SyFy television series alongside Jennifer Tilly.</p><h2 id=billy-boyd-took-on-the-role-in-39-seed-of-chucky-39>Billy Boyd Took On The Role In 'Seed Of Chucky'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Seed Of Chucky was announced, fans were fascinated with who would be playing the spawn of the horror character and turns out, it was Scottish actor Billy Boyd! While Boyd is mostly known for his role in The Lord Of The Rings, diehard Chucky fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">know him for voicing Glen and Glenda</a> alongside Dourif and Tilly.</p><p>Although the actor didn't necessarily play Chucky himself, his iconic portrayal of Glen/Glenda is one that fans will forever remember. While this was his sole role in the Child's Play franchise, Billy Boyd reprised the voice of Glen in Chucky's Family Vacation back in 2004.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was 'Child's Play' Based On A True Story?</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-hamill-voiced-chucky-in-the-remake>Mark Hamill Voiced Chucky In The Remake</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mark Hamill is no stranger to the limelight! The star has been part of two major series that fans know and love him for, one of which was animated, and the other, a live-action. While his resume speaks for itself, Hamill is now adding yet another iconic role to his roster of iconic character portrayals.</p><p>Although he'll always be known for his role as Luke Skywalker in the film series, Star Wars, Chucky fans will certainly remember him for his voicing of Chucky in the hit film's 2019 remake, Child's Play. Mark was personally approached by the film's director, Lars Klevberg regarding the reboot, and it was an easy decision to make from there.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Hamill shared</a> how, "He [Lars] already laid out his vision for the film, before I read it. And then they sent me this script and I thought the crucial element that was different from the original, which I love," the actor said, and the rest is history!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Do The Voice Actors On 'The Simpsons' Make?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmedOhnGaZk6m8s7%2BMm5yhoZ6ZerW0xGatqKGTmnqwsoycn66bm658</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
