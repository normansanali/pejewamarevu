He later took on a more unqiue role as the “Wicket” this Ewok is the one that Leia and Luke interact with during several scenes in “The Return of the Jedi.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=warwick-davis-early-life></span>Warwick Davis Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Warwick Ashley Davis was born in Epson, Surrey, England on February 3, 1970. Davis was born with a rare form of dwarfism known as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. This condition is not the same as “typical” dwarfism. Warwick’s grandmother overheard a radio advertisement for a casting call when he was 11 years old, asking for people under the height of four feet. The audition was for “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=warwick-davis-net-worth-career></span>Warwick Davis Net Worth & Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Warwick was already a huge Star Wars fan when he auditioned for “Return of the Jedi.” Initially cast as an extra Ewok, Davis considered it a dream come true to be a part of the science fiction franchise he adored. However, Warwick was given an even bigger role in the film when he was cast as the new “Wicket.” This Ewok is the one with whom Leia and Luke interact in several scenes in “The Return of the Jedi.”</p><p>Warwick Davis began his career as an extra Ewok during the time Kenny Baker, the person who was supposed to play Wicket, became ill. In that regard, George Lucas chose Davis to fill the position of a new Wicket based on the way he portrayed himself as an Ewok. The actor based his Ewok adventures on his dog, who would nod his head whenever he noticed something strange.</p><p>During the year 1987, he was assigned to Elstree Studios in London to meet with George Lucas and Ron Howard. That corresponding meeting was held in order to deliberate anew on a film project, namely Willow, which was written with Davis in mind.</p><p>This actor portrayed the character of Filius Flitwick, a professor in the well-known Harry Potter films. Furthermore, in the previous two films, he played the white-mustached Flitwick, and in the third episode of the series, he played a black-haired person who is an unnamed choir player. Davis also appears in one episode of the well-known ITV series Perspectives: Warwick Davis – The Seven Dwarfs of Auschwitz in 2013.</p><p>In the corresponding role, he was tasked with discovering the story of the Ovitz family, who were a visiting musical type troupe that included seven dwarfs who allowed Nazi Auschwitz concentration camp and even trials of Josef Mengele. The actor will appear in Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a role, but the role has not yet been finalized. However, the film is scheduled to be released in 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=warwick-davis-net-worth></span>Warwick Davis Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2021, Warwick Davis’s net worth is estimated to be $10 million.&nbsp;Warwick Davis is one of those actors who has largely ignored the fact that he has dwarfism in the form of major physical defects in order to focus on his career as an actor and television presenter. He has amassed such a large net worth and fame that has nothing to do with his physical appearance. He made the majority of his money as an actor, but he also earned money as a director, producer, and television host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BRp8Sqr8pmm5qumah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqm71mapopuYYra0edOhnGaZk6m8s3nAp5tmrKZivaa%2B0qilmqSZqcZuv9OaqWavkafAbrHWqKJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
