However, others noted that he was just trying to put himself in a better situation.</p><p>After this footage went viral, fans began posting <a href=# rel>alleged footage of King Lil Jay</a> while incarcerated. In the footage, reshared by No Jumper below, you can see a man sitting on a bench in the jail. From there, another man comes into the picture and sits on his lap. They also share a kiss before other inmates enter the scene. Many claimed that that this was Jay, although he has since issued a statement, denying this was him.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Man Says He Makes Money By Showing Chicago Tourists King Von Mural</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-lil-jay-speaks>King Lil Jay Speaks</h2></span><p>“Soon as y’all put dude up actually saying some gay s*** y’all would try to put me on there.
