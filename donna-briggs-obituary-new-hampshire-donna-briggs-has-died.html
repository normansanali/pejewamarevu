She had been a lifelong resident of the region. Her husband Sewell Briggs lost away in 1995, and her son Tim Briggs passed away in 1988. Both of these individuals passed away before she did.</p><p>She is survived by her son Daniel Briggs and daughter in law Mary Margaret Briggs, both of Vashon, Washington; her daughter Nicki Kuhn of Santa Rosa, California; her three grandchildren, Sean Kuhn of Trinity, Florida, Sam Briggs of Seattle, and Flora Briggs of Vashon; her two great-granddaughters Lily Kuhn and Hannah Kuhn; her brother Gerald Martin of Benicia, California; and her cousin Shelley Williams of Clarkston.</p><p>Donna received her education in business at the Kinman Business School in Spokane after she graduated from Pomeroy High School in 1945. The school was located in the city of Spokane. After being married in 1945, the pair decided to start their new life together in Pomeroy. They began their new life there. They first played golf in Pomeroy, and then later moved on to Clarkston, where they also had a nice time.</p><p>They enjoyed the company of their fellow villagers and the friends they made there for a good portion of their time in Pomeroy. Following a period of time, Donna moved to Clarkston, and it was there that she remained until 2018, when she finally made the move to the Vashon Community care center. The funeral services have not been held as of yet, but the burial will take place in the Pomeroy Cemetery at some point later on in the year.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsM6npZplkqe2qLPSZqaboaSqrrPFjKecsGWYlrqxv8eiqZ5llKS7r62Mm6min5eoeqmt0mabop2UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
