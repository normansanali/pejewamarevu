Fortunately, Leo Svete, on</span><i><span> Are You The One</span></i><span>, chose Brooke in the first match-up ceremony, and the feelings were reciprocated — leaving Will in dismay.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this “Leo Svete Bio” to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Leo Svete On Are You The One?</b></h3><p><span>The wait is over! </span><i><span>Are You The One?</span></i><span> is back for its ninth installment after a four-year hiatus.

Thereafter, the show uses a special matchmaking algorithm tool to ensure all contestants have a “perfect match.” So, the goal is to figure out who they are destined for through a “truth booth.”</span></p><p><span>If the group can figure out every true match in 10 or fewer attempts, they get to split a $1,000,00 prize.

I was like, ‘Geez save some for the rest of us.’.”</span></p><p><span>Again, Brooke reassured him, “I’m not mean, I promise!” She even hinted that&nbsp; Will would be her number one if he was nicer.</span></p><p><span>But ultimately, in the first match-up ceremony, Leo picked Brooke as he dipped her back and kissed her. Flustered, Brooke said, “I came into this not thinking I was going to crush on someone so hard so fast.”</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Will said he felt like he was only Brooke’s shoulder to cry on when Leo wasn’t giving her attention.</span></p><p><span>Before appearing on </span><i><span>Are You The One</span></i><span>, Leo was in a relationship with a lovely lady who’s heavenly featured on his FB.
