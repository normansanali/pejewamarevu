Below, you will find the best loadout for each class to maximize your performance and kill count on the battlefield.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Light data-injectable=false>Best Loadout for the Light Class in The Finals</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Light-Class-The-Finals.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>The best Light Class in The Finals is one that can be quick on its feet through a mix of the right weapon, specialization, and gadgets. To start, we have the <strong>V9S</strong> as the best weapon for the Light class due to the fast firing rate, pinpoint accuracy, and high damage to finish it off.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Cloaking Device</strong> is a nice touch, a specialization that turns you invisible when standing still and almost invisible while moving. Using this at the appropriate time can make the Light class great at flanking enemies or escaping an area while in a pickle, helping you stay alive.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>As for gadgets, it boils down to what works for you. The three I believe work best for the Light class are the Goo Grenade, Stun Grenade, and Vanishing Bomb. The <strong>Goo Grenade </strong>can be used for defensive measures, creating a barricade resistant to gunfire and blocking enemy paths. The <strong>Stun Grenade</strong> does as it implies — stuns the enemy. Lastly, the <strong>Vanishing Bomb</strong> will make you hard to see, allowing you to escape quickly.</p><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> V9S</li><li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Cloaking Device</li><li><strong>Gadgets:</strong> Goo Grenade, Stun Grenade, Vanishing Bomb</li></ul><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Best Settings for Visibility in The Finals</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Medium data-injectable=false>Best Loadout for the Medium Class in The Finals</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Medium-Class-The-Finals.jpg><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>The Medium class is excellent for those who want a balanced approach to The Finals, and we have the best loadout for you. The best weapon for the Medium class is the <strong>AKM</strong>, an automatic weapon that is great at both short and medium ranges. It is super accurate and provides some of the best damage for an automatic gun currently in The Finals.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>For a specialization, there is no doubt that you want to choose the <strong>Healing Beam</strong>. This helpful tool will allow you to shoot off a blue beam that can heal your teammates from a short distance. This becomes especially helpful when defending an objective or keeping your squad alive when bombarded by opponents.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Lastly, we have gadgets we recommend choosing: the Jump Pad, Gas Mine, and Defibrillator. The <strong>Jump Pad</strong> is a useful gadget that can help you maneuver around the battlefield quicker, out of enemy sight, as it will allow you to jump to great heights. The <strong>Gas Mine</strong> can damage a handful of your opponents at once, creating a toxic gas in the surrounding area — potentially leading to double and triple kills. Meanwhile, the <strong>Defibrillator</strong> will instantly revive your squadmates, making you an all-around better teammate.</p><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> AKM</li><li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Healing Beam</li><li><strong>Gadgets: </strong>Jump Pad, Gas Mine, Defibrillator</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Heavy data-injectable=false>Best Loadout for the Heavy Class in The Finals</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Heavy-Class-The-Finals.jpg><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>The Heavy class is for players looking to use a tanky playstyle, which can be quickly done with the appropriate loadout. While the Lewis Gun is a solid choice for the Heavy class, I recommend choosing the <strong>Flamethrower </strong>instead. Not only is the Flamethrower an offensive weapon, but it can also be used to help deactivate the opponent’s gadgets. For example, you can use the Flamethrower to eliminate gas clouds, Goo from Goo Grenades, and more. It doesn’t deal the most damage but has a solid range.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Mesh Shield</strong> is a solid choice for specialization for the Heavy class as it will allow you to go into third-person view, creating a shield in front of you with 750 hit points. This will protect you from oncoming fire, helping you stay alive, and also allow you to get free shots at your opponent without worrying about taking cover. Additionally, your teammates can get behind you and use the Mesh Shield to their advantage as well.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>As for the Heavy-class gadgets, we recommend you choose the C4, Frag Grenade, and RPG-7. These three gadgets are the best for a tanky playstyle, giving you the chance to make everything explode. The <strong>C4</strong> can be planted in well-thought-out spots, killing enemies trying to flank you. The <strong>Frag Grenade</strong> can kill your opponents in rooms, essentially clearing out the room. And lastly, the <strong>RPG-7 </strong>is an accurate explosive weapon that can be used to either kill opponents or bust down walls and ceilings.</p><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> Flamethrower</li><li><strong>Specialization: </strong>Mesh Shield</li><li><strong>Gadgets: </strong>C4, Frag Grenade, RPG-7</li></ul><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=false>That’s all you need to know about the best load-outs for every class in The Finals! If you find one not working for you, that is okay; test out other options in the practice arena, and hopefully, you will find a good fit. I do believe, though, that these builds are a solid foundation and will lead you to getting more kills and improving overall performance on the battlefield.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
