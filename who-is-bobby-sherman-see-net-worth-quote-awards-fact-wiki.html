It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is equal to $10 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016, the main sources having been acting and singing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bobby-sherman-net-worth-10-million></span>Bobby Sherman Net Worth $10 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>To begin with, Sherman was raised in Santa Monica, California, matriculating from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys in 1961. He also completed vocal studies at Georgia Massey’s School of Song and Dance. Afterwards, Bobby pursued a career in the entertainment industry which added huge sums to the total size of his net worth.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, Sherman initially became famous thanks to the television series aired on ABC – “Shinding!” (1964 – 1966). For some years, he tried to record singles and to make a breakthrough in the music industry, but was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, he was cast as a guest star in the sitcom “The Monkees” (1966 – 1968), however, Sherman landed a successful role in the television series “Here Come the Brides” (1968 – 1970) alongside co-stars Bridget Hanley, Robert Brown, David Soul and Joan Blondell; the ratings of the series were impressive, thus the net worth and the popularity of Bobby Sherman and other co-stars significantly increased. In 1969, Sherman released the single “Little Woman”, which became popular and reached third place on the Billboard Hot 100 chart – it sold more than a million copies, and was certified gold in the USA. The other hits released by Sherman were “Julie, Do Ya Love Me” (1970) which made it to 5th place on the Billboard Hot 100; “Easy Come, Easy Go” (1970) – 9th place; “Jennifer” (1971) sixtieth place on the chart, “La, La, La” (1972) ninth place and “The Drum” (1972) twenty-sixth place. All added usefully to his net worth.</p><p>It is worth mentioning the fact that he appeared on the big screen too – in 1968 he landed a role in Christopher Jones’ “Wild in the Streets” by Barry Shear, then the lead role in the drama film “He Is My Brother” (1975) by Edward Dmytryk. Moreover, he appeared in a number of TV series as a guest star, however, after his role in the series “Emergency!” (1986) Sherman decided to focus more on his private life.</p><p>In 1998, after many years of silence Sherman toured alongside ex-Monkees&nbsp;Peter Noon and Davy Jones in The Teen Idol Tour. In 2005, he was listed as the 8th in the 25 Greatest Teen Idols by TV Guide magazine.</p><p>Finally, the personal life of the actor and singer, Sherman was married to Patti Carnell from 1971 to 1979; they had two children, Christopher and Tyler, who were born in the early 1980s. Bobby has been married to Brigitte since 2011.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bobby Sherman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 22, 1943</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Monica, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.75&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, actor, songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Birmingham High School, Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, Georgia Massey’s School of Song and Dance</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Patti Carnel (1971-1979), Brigitte Carnell (2011-)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Christopher Sherman, Tyler Sherman</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Robert Cabot Sherman Sr., Juanita Sherman, Easy Come, Easy Go, Julie, Do Ya Love Me, Julie Do You Love Me</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Darlene Mack</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0792385</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-sherman-mn0000062729</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>“Here Comes Bobby – With Love, Bobby” (2001), “With Love, Bobby: The Scrapbook Album” (1970), “Portrait of Bobby” (1995), “Getting Together” (1995), “Greatest Hits” (1971), “Bobby Sherman” (1969),</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Honey West” (1964), “Monkees at the Movies” (1967), “Wild in the Streets”, “He Is My Brother” (1975), “Emergency!” (1986)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Here Come the Brides” (1968-1970 ABC), “Shindig!”, “All in the Family”, “Getting Together” (1971), “The Partridge Family” (1971), “The Mod Squad”, “Ellery Queen”, “Murder She Wrote”, Good Day LA, “The Rosie O’Donnell Show”, “Good Morning America”, “The Tonight Show”, “Sanchez of Bel Air” (1986), “H…</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dated Comedian Vicki Lawrence for a brief time in 1969.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sal Mineo bought Sherman a set of drums when he helped him break into the music industry in 1963-1964.
