"Ryan also plans to shoot PSAs — public service announcements — with cast members in character. "They're going to speak directly to the audience and I think they're going to be very impactful," explained Ryan.</p><p id=e3evHisf-9 data-wc=50>Despite Cory's relapse earlier this year, which forced him to enter rehab in March, Kevin admitted that his tragic death still came as a shock.

He was not a problem," he said.</p><p id=eUgXM8m7IA data-wc=23>The 31-year-old heartthrob was found dead in a hotel room in Vancouver, Canada last month of "a mixed-drug toxicity involving heroin and alcohol."</p><p id=eGUnK9jeEQ data-wc=37>The service added that Cory's death was unlikely to have been intentional, saying, "It should be noted that at this point there is no evidence to suggest Mr Monteith's death was anything other than a most-tragic accident."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
