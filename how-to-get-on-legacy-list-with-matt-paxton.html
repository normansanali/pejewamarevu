Often families feel hindered by the overwhelming and daunting process.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: PBS</span></figure><p>Featured families can work with Matt and his team of professionals to learn more about their family’s past and what to carry with them into the future. The show is touching, with emotional peaks and pits experienced throughout the processes of learning and letting go.</p><p>Aside from his experience on Hoarders, Matt has over 20 years' worth of experience in helping people settle estates and overhaul cleanouts of houses and properties. His passion for helping others began after he had to settle estates for his father, stepfather, and both grandfathers in the same year – talk about an emotional crash course in dealing with estates.</p><p>But that experience didn’t deter Matt. Instead, it inspired him to delve into his own family’s history and discover its legacy, and now, he’s helping others do the same. To quote Matt: “Every family has a legacy. Sometimes, they just need a little help finding it.”</p><p>New episodes of Legacy List with Matt Paxton typically air on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on PBS, but check local listings for other days and times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGK8r3nLnp6am6liuaq%2F02auoqyYYrqiwNNmp5qwpKS7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
