And it all started with a charming interview.</p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>In a video first uploaded in early August, viewers got their first glimpse at the eager young boy who’s made corn on the cob an overnight sensation. The initial video shows an interviewer ask the boy about things that he likes, and is greeted by a gripping homage to corn. The video has since gone starkly viral, collecting more than 700,000 views and 130,000 likes, and quickly branched off into its own dedicated trend. One remix and thousands of stitches later, the video persists as one of TikTok’s current favorites.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-original-corn-video data-injectable=false>What is the original corn video?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@recesstherapy href=#>@recesstherapy</a><p>Children of the… corn? 😂 🌽 <a title=recesstherapy href=#>#recesstherapy</a> <a title=corn href=#>#corn</a> <a title=cornisgood href=#>#cornisgood</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=favorite href=#>#favorite</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Recess Therapy" href=#>♬ original sound – Recess Therapy</a></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>The corn video that prompted TikTok’s latest trend was uploaded by user @recesstherapy on Aug. 4. It serves as a replacement for the actual original, posted sometime earlier, which had its sound mysteriously removed. That left people to lean on the early August video for all their corn-loving needs.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>The video features a young boy with a girthy corn on the cob in hand. In response to a question posed by the interviewer, the boy proceeds to enthuse about all things corn. A few lines in particular stand out, as the boy notes that he “can’t imagine a more beautiful thing” than corn, and eagerly shouts “it’s corn!”</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Within a few weeks, the original sound had spread to all corners of TikTok, and was in the process of getting a remix. By Aug. 18, user @schmoyoho had released a flawless remix of the viral sound, featuring plenty of corn love and several satisfying crunches as the young corn enthusiast takes bites of his buttery treat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@schmoyoho href=#>@schmoyoho</a><p>intro song for any meal/snack with corn 🌽 – from iconic interview on @doingthings</p><a title="♬ Corn but it becomes a song and unites world - schmoyoho" href=#>♬ Corn but it becomes a song and unites world – schmoyoho</a></figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>The remix was all the internet needed to make the corn sound into a viral sensation.

Even now, closing in on a month after the initial clip hit the platform, TikTok remains entrenched in fresh, crunchy corn videos. Many people started by simply stitching the original audio, or the remixed song, to showcase their reactions to the charming clips, but soon the trend branched off into new territory.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">corn song</a>, titled “Corn but it becomes a song and unites world,” has already been used in nearly 250,000 videos, and more join the trend every day.
