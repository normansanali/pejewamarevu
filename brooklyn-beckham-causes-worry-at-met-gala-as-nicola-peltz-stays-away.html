He accessorized with a gold chain and black shoes.</p><p>When asked by reporters about Nicola’s absence, Brooklyn said he was “missing” her but jokingly added, “Guess I’ll have to settle for all these beautiful celebrities instead.”</p><p>Last month, Nicola, 29, also <a href=# rel=noopener>missed her mother-in-law </a><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong>’s 50th birthday party, again because she was spending time with her grandmother. Victoria celebrated her big day with an elaborate bash at a private members club in London that was attended by Brooklyn and her other children with husband <strong>David Beckham</strong>: sons Romeo, 21, and Cruz, 19, and daughter Harper, 12.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brooklyn’s attendance at Monday’s event marked his fourth consecutive appearance at the Met Gala, albeit his first without Nicola.

She’s always there for me. I’m always there for her. We support each other more than anyone. She’s the best. We’re very happy. First year has been great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2FsLvKpbCnZZKasKy0wKZknJmlqLK0edaoqauxXZbBbrnErWSgmZyWeqK%2FjKegnKeclnqxscutsWarpJbGtHnAsJiyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
