We’ll just see what happens… I don’t think we’re gonna put any pressure on it. She did mention something about coming over here for New Years, so potentially we’d be linking up then. If not, definitely the new year when I head over to the States, for sure.”</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Given that he is planning on spending some time in the United States in 2024, could a relationship between Callum and Deb actually come to fruition?
