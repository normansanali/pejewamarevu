A suspicious Sarandon tries to blame the Beasties for the wanton destruction, using pie remnants as proof.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-5-0-0@published data-word-count=28><strong>Rashida Jones:</strong> The first of the short’s many, many two-second cameos, Jones walks down the street, is come on to by the Beasties, and says, “You wish, turkeys.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-6-0-0@published data-word-count=25><strong>Will Arnett:</strong> If you’re still in the throes of Arrested Development withdrawal, enjoy Arnett essentially playing G.O.B. here (expensive suit and indignant “Come on!” included).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-7-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>Adam Scott:</strong> A cabdriver. This is the point in the short where the audience started murmuring the names of the celebrities they recognized, so there was a lot of, “That’s Adam Scott!” (and just as much “Who’s Adam Scott?”).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-8-0-0@published data-word-count=12><strong>Rainn Wilson:</strong> A churchgoer, he is offended by the Beasties’ post-party antics.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-9-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> The maitre d’ of a café that the Beasties terrorize, and between him and <strong>Steve Buscemi</strong> as the establishment’s waiter, the recipient of most of the audience’s “Hey, I recognize that famous celebrity who is making a two-second cameo” goodwill.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-10-0-0@published data-word-count=45><strong>Amy Poehler, Roman Coppola, Shannyn Sossamon, Mary Steenburgen, Alicia Silverstone, Laura Dern, Milo Ventimiglia, and Jody Hill:</strong> All patrons of the café, Poehler and Steenburgen are lucky enough to get close-ups, but the rest of the actors were there to add barely glimpsed celebrity flavor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-11-0-0@published data-word-count=13><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Another café patron, dressed as Vincent Van Gogh, for some reason.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-12-0-0@published data-word-count=56><strong>Chloë Sevigny, Kirsten Dunst, and Maya Rudolph:</strong> This is the point where the short started to weirdly resemble Madonna’s video for “Music,” as the Beasties clamber into town cars with three colorfully wigged metal chicks, who indulge in all manner of illegal activity (drugs, stabbing) with them. All it needed was a Sacha Baron Cohen cameo.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-13-0-0@published data-word-count=28><strong>David Cross:</strong> Cross <a href=#>reprises his role</a> as Nathaniel Hornblower, the pseudonymous alter ego of director Adam Yauch. Complicated? Perhaps, but you only get three seconds of him anyway.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-14-0-0@published data-word-count=33><strong>Orlando Bloom:</strong> Credited as “Johnny Ryall,” he would appear to be the character from the Beasties’ track from Paul’s Boutique, except that Orlando Bloom is way too pretty to play a homeless alcoholic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-15-0-0@published data-word-count=70><strong>Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and Jack Black:</strong> Arriving in a Delorean, the three play time-traveling versions of the older Beasties, with a cowbell-striking Ferrell as Ad-Rock, Reilly as Mike D, and Black as MCA (or, as the younger Beasties put it, “The ghosts of License to Ill future”). It isn’t long before the Beasties of both generations get in a dance-off, which culminates in a literal, endless pissing contest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-620d4c1cfdd7264265e041b5bc973fd4-16-0-0@published data-word-count=52><strong>Adam Horovitz, Mike D, Adam Yauch:</strong> Finally, the actual Beasties appear as cops, hauling the faux Beasties away in a paddy wagon driven by <strong>Martin Starr</strong>. Still, their most significant contribution to the short might be the new, thumping tracks on the soundtrack, including a remix of “Too Many Rappers,” featuring Nas.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>A Guide to Every Celebrity Cameo in Fight for Your Right Revisited</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloamdgZnyntcahq5ien6esurvUq5aroZedwaC%2BxK%2BgrKGkmrGgfY2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
