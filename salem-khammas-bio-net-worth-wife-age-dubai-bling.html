Because of his demeanor, he has won over many fans. Despite the conflict, he is the CEO of four businesses in the United Arab Emirates. Ebraheem referred to Salem as his “brother” when he first met Dubai Bling, but they soon got into a battle over Danya, their co-star. For its second season on Netflix, the show welcomed back both original cast members and newcomers like Salem. When he referred to Danya as a “child” at the dinner party, chaos ensued.</p><p>After referring to DJ Bliss’ wife Danya as a child who should “stay at home,” Salem made quite the appearance on Dubai Bling. However, viewers believe he was unconcerned by the turmoil between Ebraheem and Danya.
