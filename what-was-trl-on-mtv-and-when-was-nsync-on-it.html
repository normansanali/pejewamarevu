And where else can you see an extremely star-struck Rihanna <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> hottie of the noughties Josh Hartnett? Do you even remember Josh Hartnett?

Many of those appearances can be found on YouTube, and you’ll find them just looking like kids and generally being cheeky, teasing each other and Carson Daly like old pals.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why are we reminiscing about TRL?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>Now-Today Show host Carson Daly did a heartfelt tribute to his days on TRL recently on his current gig, commemorating the 30th anniversary of his first appearance on the MTV countdown show. Also stirring up interest and reviving curiosity on the defunct TRL, NSYNC recently appeared on the popular YouTube show Hot Ones with Sean Evans. Yes, Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Joey Fatone made it through the entire lineup of increasingly hotter wings. Watch till the end if you want to see Fatone drool on himself. Totally not kidding.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>The appearance was hilarious, we loved seeing these guys rib each other and use profanity. Of particular interest was watching them discuss their days of appearing on TRL and describing the Wild West that was once MTV and the pop music terrain of that time.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Perhaps — if the reunion tour rumors turn out to be true — we can catch more of the boy band (what are we supposed to call them now? Man band?) hanging out together, being interviewed together, and recording more music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZq6aq12pv615zqdkpqymYq6vsIywn56mXayutHnNrLCnm12ku26102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
