OK.’’</p><p>The laughter went on, Union jokingly saying how she thought that ‘precisely’ because she was a ‘thot!’</p><p>Then, her husband joined in on the fun, apologizing in the name of the Wade family and stressing that it’s ‘not who we are anymore.’</p><p>At the end of the day, however, they were messing around while remembering the past, but Union expressed how glad she actually was that the Currys did not follow her piece of advice.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She went on to gush over them, saying that: ‘Listen, you guys are unicorns. Like, there are very, very few people I have met who have been consistent. I have known you guys over a decade and there are a lot of people who talk about faith and there is a lot of people who talk about moving the culture forward, but something is not real somewhere. And when people are like, ‘Are they real?’ I’m like, ‘yes!’’</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlq%2BztcSlo55lpaO2sLqMq5ycmZyhwG6tw6%2BgrKGenHqixcSsn5plkaOxbr%2FTnqehZZOqv7PFjK2mZp2emXq1tMinnqxlkpawrHnWoZynZaSdsrp50q2Yq6yVmXqlrdOipaBlY25%2FcX6WaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
