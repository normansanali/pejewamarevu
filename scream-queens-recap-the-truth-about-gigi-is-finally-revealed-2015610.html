Will Chanel No. 6 (<strong>Lea Michele</strong>) make it out alive without being stabbed by a Louboutin heel? Read on, brave souls.</p><p><strong>RIP, Roadkill Lady</strong></p><p>Grace (<strong>Skyler Samuels</strong>) and Pete (<strong>Diego Boneta</strong>) made the mistake of visiting an old Kappa alum in her trailer home, and the woman paid a huge price for blabbing about her past: death by Red Devil. This poor old broad was just minding her business munchin’ on some roadkill when our favorite horned super-freak showed up and stabbed her. It’s like, you’re chillin’ out, eating an armadillo, and then BOOM. Dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>What Happened That Night</strong></p><p>Wondering what happened to the Bathtub Baby? Well, it might be Grace. This beanie-obsessed good girl confronted her dad, Wes (<strong>Oliver Hudson</strong>), about the possibility that she was born during a ’90s sorority party, but he accused her of being on bath salts and denied the entire thing. Psh, whatever, “Wes,” if that’s even your real name.</p><p><strong>Pray for the Gravestones</strong></p><p><strong><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></strong></p><p>As we’ve come to know, Chad Radwell (<strong>Glen Powell</strong>) has a fetish for dead bodies, and this week he was casually masturbating next to a gravestone when who should show up? Chanel No. 6, who promptly admitted that she’s a) obsessed with him, and b) wants to take over Kappa. She also uttered the sentence, “Maybe she’ll let you in the backdoor” while talking about herself, which was weird for all parties involved (except Chad…he was definitely turned on).</p><p><strong>Spoiler Alert: The Chanels are Feminists</strong></p><p>They might be homophobic and pretty racist, but the Chanels are raging feminists of Notorious R.B.G. proportions. Not only did Chanel (<strong>Emma Roberts</strong>) take a stance against eating cotton balls for lunch (choice quote: “I’m tired of depriving myself of joy and sustenance. For what, so a boy will like me?”), she and her sisters beat up a bro for objectifying them.</p><p>Please enjoy Chanel’s rant: “I recently took a women’s studies class –– yes, because it was a requirement –– but I learned a lot anyways. Like, the culture that says it’s okay for a man to objectify a woman for her appearance is the same culture that pressures girls as young as 10 to have eating disorders.” Preach.</p><p><strong>Gigi Is the “Hag of Shady Lane”</strong></p><p>Update: There’s a Haunted House near campus where a crazy lady affectionately known as the “Hag of Shady Lane” spent a lot of time chopping up dolls. Creepy, yes, but Grace discovered that said Hag cared for the Bathtub Baby! Huge news, but even more jaw-dropping? In the final moments of the show, the Hag was revealed to be none other than Gigi Caldwell (<strong>Nasim Pedrad</strong>).</p><p><strong>Uhm…Zayday Might Be Dead</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The horror! Chanel No. 6 met Chad at the Hag’s Haunted House so he could “attack her crack” (yikes), but their hookup took a turn for the terrifying. Not only did Chanel No. 6 find Ms. Bean’s (<strong>Jan Hoag</strong>) rotting corpse, she and Chad got stuck in a basement with the remains of Coney the Ice Cream Cone and Chanel No. 2 (<strong>Ariana Grande</strong>). Oh, and to make matters worse, the Red Devil attacked Zayday (<strong>Keke Palmer</strong>)! Did she make it out alive? You’ll have to wait until next week to find out.</p><p>Scream Queens airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqcqpWWum691J6cp6tdp7Kkrc9mq6GdXam%2FtsDHZpibp6Wpeqi1xqJkoqtdm7avrculsGaqlauyorjEnWRraGFqg3J8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
