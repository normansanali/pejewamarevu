Erick Redbeard (formerly known as former WWE Superstar Erick Rowan) recently sat down with Steve Fall of NBC Sports Boston to discuss a wide variety of subjects. When asked why he never signed with All Elite Wrestling despite appearing multiple times for the promotion, Redbeard said there was never a conversation about it, and he didn’t want to remind everyone of the loss of Brodie Lee."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When asked why he never signed with All Elite Wrestling despite appearing multiple times for the promotion, Redbeard said there was never a conversation about it, and he didn’t want to remind everyone of the loss of <a href=#>Brodie Lee</a>.</p><p>“It was never a conversation,” Erick Redbeard said. “I was doing and pursuing my own things. And like, I don’t know, it was never a thing, and I didn’t, at that time especially, I didn’t want to be that guy that distracts and always reminds people of a loss, especially that quickly. And with The Dark Order, I wanted nothing to do with it. And that’s not to say that like I’m better.</p><p>“What I’m saying is I wanted nothing to do with it because that’s his legacy. Like if it’s gonna fizzle out, I want it to fizzle out. But he made it and created that in such a quick amount of time that he had left that I want that to be the memory of him. His TNT championship, his Dog Collar matches; I want that all to be held up here. I wanted nothing to do with that. So like, even if there was a conversation, I wouldn’t have seen myself having a slot there.”</p><p>What do you make of Erick Redbeard’s comments?
