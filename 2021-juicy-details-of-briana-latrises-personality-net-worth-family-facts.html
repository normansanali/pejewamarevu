She is the child of producer and recording executive, Kendu Isaacs. Kendu had Briana with his teenage girlfriend whose identity is not known. Being the only child of her parents, Briana has no biological sibling. She, however, has two stepbrothers; Nas and Jordan from her dad’s previous marriage.</p><p>In regards to her educational qualifications, it is not clear where Briana attended school or what level of education she acquired. It is, however, safe to assume that the reality star is properly educated considering how shrewd she sounds while expressing herself during interviews.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-she-is-related-to-mary-j-blige></span><b>How She is Related to Mary J. Blige</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Briana Latrise’s mum and dad were never married. Worse still, her relationship with them has been nothing to write home about. Unlike most celebrities who share a strong bond with their parents and are quick to say the nicest things about them any chance they get, Briana is a clear exception.</p><p>As a child, she had no relationship with her dad. She reportedly did not even have his phone number. As for her mom who raised her, Briana revealed that they scarcely agree on anything. Their constant conflict eventually landed her on the streets where she began meddling with alcoholism and drugs.</p><p>Things, however, seemed to have taken a positive turn for Briana Latrise after her dad met and married famous singer and songwriter Mary J. Blige. Kendu, who initially started out as Mary’s manager, later tied the knot with her in December 2003.</p><p>Now her stepmom, Blige treated Briana like her own child despite her indulgences, as she had been through similar woes when she was younger. Latrise lived with the duo and soon began dreaming of having a career in the entertainment industry like them. With their help, she soon landed juicy opportunities, the first being at the age of 15, when she got an internship with Apple Music executive and Interscope Records co-founder, Jimmy Iovine.</p><p>Unfortunately, things once again went sour for Briana after her dad and stepmom began having serious issues in their relationship. When her relationship with Kendu went sour, Blige cut ties with his daughter, leaving her devastated. In the same vein, Briana’s seemingly repaired relationship with her dad also fell like a pack of cards. The reality star revealed that in 2013, she hit a rough patch in life and was left stranded, pregnant, and homeless while her dad and stepmom did nothing to help her.</p><p>Kendu Isaacs and Mary J. Blige eventually divorced after the latter filed an application in 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. Although Briana stood on her dad’s side during his divorce battles with Blige which came to an end in June 2018, she surprisingly referred to him as “garbage” and ” a dirtbag” in a November 2018 Instagram post. She said so because he was not showing any care towards herself and his grandson, Mercury Turner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brianas-relationship-history></span><strong>Briana’s Relationship History</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated above, Briana Latrise&nbsp;has a son. Not much is, however, known about him and his father who she clearly no longer has any relationship with.</p><p>The reality star is known to have once dated DJ and producer, Iman Omari. The duo’s relationship appeared to be loving to the public but it was anything but that as it was filled with conflicts. The couple eventually parted ways in 2016 after Briana was physically abused by Iman. The altercation left her with a bloodied face, several bruises, and a concussion.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-about-how-briana-latrise-earns-a-living></span><strong>Facts About How Briana Latrise Earns a Living</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Briana Latrise achieved fame in 2016 when she was cast to appear on the We TV reality show, Growing Up Hip Hop (GUHH). Initially, the young girl earned a supporting role on the show but her love for controversies quickly saw her become one of the main characters. She has since grown to become one of the most important casts of the show.</p><p>Having become a regular on GUHH, Briana is believed to be paid a juicy salary that is not known to the public. She has since been able to use that to open up several other financially rewarding doors for herself. On her Instagram page, she describes herself as an artist, entertainer, and writer who does everything. On her self-named website, she introduces herself as “a creative, a writer, and a business”.</p><p>In regards to her artistry, Briana has done some work in photography and painting.
