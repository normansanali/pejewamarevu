Rocking a black, sleeveless Versace vest dress and lace-up boots, Minaj took the stage at the Sunset Tower Hotel to accept the Fashion Rebel Award.</p><p>“We all have insecurities,” she said in her acceptance speech. “I want to say, shout-out to all of the kick-ass women, not only in this room, but all around the world. You know what, we win and fail in the public eye. That’s not easy to do. People think they know what it requires. People think they can do it. Everybody wants to walk in your shoes, until you put them in your shoes.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The chart-topping diva also congratulated women everywhere for their strength and confidence. “It takes guts, it takes balls to fail and to make mistakes in the public eye, and to read s–tty comments about yourself every f–king day and to still have a beautiful f–king smile on your f–king face,” she said. “I love you guys so much for believing in me. I took some time off to rest, and now it’s game time, bitches.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Minaj dropped three new singles, “Regret In Your Tears,” “Changed It” and “No Frauds,” last month.
