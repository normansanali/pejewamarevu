She’s just silly and she’s not shy. How I was as a kid is very much how True is.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Strong Looks Better Naked&nbsp;</i>author and the Canada native, 31, <a href=#>dated on and off between 2016 and 2021</a>. Days before the reality TV star gave birth to True, <a href=#>the basketball player</a> was <a href=#>accused of cheating with multiple women</a> but the twosome weathered the scandal and stayed together. Thompson and Kardashian <a href=#>split for the first time</a> after he kissed<a href=#><strong> Kylie Jenner</strong></a>’s former friend <a href=#><strong>Jordyn Woods</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;</i>alum</a> and the Chicago Bulls athlete maintained <a href=#>an amicable coparenting relationship</a> before <a href=#>they eventually reconciled</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=p1>Amid Kardashian and Thompson’s reunion, the pair had been <a href=#>candid about their desire to expand their family</a> and welcome a second child via surrogate.</p><p class=p1>“[My doctor] said that I would be, like, a high-risk carrier for a pregnancy,” she said <a href=#>during a March 2021 episode of&nbsp;<i>KUWTK</i></a>. “I’m not gonna get into specifics on camera, but they said it’s an 80 percent chance I’ll miscarry.&nbsp;I almost miscarried with True&nbsp;at the beginning. But I didn’t know that was a lingering thing. … She said she would feel terrible putting [an embryo] in without warning me that most likely I wouldn’t be able to carry.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us&nbsp;</i>confirmed <a href=#>they split for good in June 2021</a>, months before news broke that Thompson had welcomed his third child, <a href=#>Theo</a>, with <a href=#><strong>Maralee Nichols</strong></a>. The&nbsp;former Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player&nbsp;was <a href=#>being sued for child support</a> by Nichols, 31, who alleged that <a href=#>he is the father of her son</a>, now 7 months. According to the court documents, the fitness influencer claimed that she hooked up with Thompson on his birthday that March. While Nichols asserted that the NBA star told her that he was single, he <a href=#>had yet to break up with Kardashian</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Today, paternity test results reveal that I fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. I take full responsibility for my actions,” Thompson — who also shares son <a href=#>Prince</a>, 5, with ex <a href=#><strong>Jordan Craig</strong></a> — <a href=#>wrote via Instagram Story in January</a>. “Now that paternity has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son. I sincerely apologize to everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “Khloé, you don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you. You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years. My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you. I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The paternity scandal was <a href=#>captured during the Kardashian family’s Hulu docuseries</a>,&nbsp;<i>The Kardashians</i>, which aired last month.</p><p class=p1>“I find out what Tristan is doing with the rest of the world. A courtesy would be not doing it,” the former&nbsp;<i>Revenge Body&nbsp;</i>host — who <a href=#>has since been linked to a private equity investor</a> — said during a June episode. “But fine, if you do it, you are not even going to give me a f–king heads-up before the rest of the world?” she mentioned. “It is just an additional slap in my face. It is humiliating. I am embarrassed. I <a href=#>would prefer to be alone than to be around people</a>.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I am replaying every event, every grand gesture, every trip [and] every date. All of that was a lie. How were you able to not saying something? I feel just not really in my own body. These things are just happening and I am going through the motions. But when things happen to you a couple of times, you become immune to them. Which is really sad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vecarmK2dlqq5bsDOZpmeZZWtvaav06KloGVio7Fur8eio51lpp6ubr%2FUq6mon5GpsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
