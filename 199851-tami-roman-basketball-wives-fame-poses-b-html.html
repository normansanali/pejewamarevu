Comments celebrating her new look abound on her Instagram account. The last photograph she published that has achieved more than 25K likes in one day proves it.</p><p class=Fg>Spectacular! That is the word that defines the image that Tami Roman shows after she stopped being part of the cast of the reality show "Basketball Wives" a year ago. And it seems that the outfit she wears in the photograph she uploaded to her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B94Y9argzkU/>Instagram </a>has a lot of favorable comments.</p><p class=Fg>She knows she looks great, and she’s <a class="Xd a" href=#>not afraid of telling</a> the world about it, according to the comment Tami wrote to describe her photograph. Not to mention that the hat she wears adds a touch of drama to the whole ensemble.</p><p class=Fg>“If Griselda was a Black woman, who grew a lil weed...”</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>THE PERFECT IMAGE</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Tami has her fans constantly aware of her social media because in each one she looks more spectacular than in the previous one. She recently <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/03/12/you-look-sooo-happy-tami-roman-stuns-in-modelesque-pic/>posted a photo</a> in a green outfit, rising above animal print stilettos as she leans against a gray wall.</p><p class=Fg>Her blonde hair and curls unleashed a wave of comments in the post since it makes her look very good and practically timeless. The description that goes along this photo Tami shared, explains that she is trying different looks to find the best one for her.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>SWITCHING BETWEEN LOOKS</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Less than a week ago, Tami posted a photograph wearing an amazing <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/03/17/werq-it-fans-rave-over-tami-romans-fur-coat/>black-brown-white coat</a>, which in a few times reached over 10K likes. In addition to dazzling in the fluffy, colorful coat, the change of her hair color is noticeable.</p><p class=Fg>Her long hair now shows two contrasting shades of dark near her head, while from the middle to the ends she stands out with a platinum blonde. It should be noted that her hair matches the colors of the coat she is wearing.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>NEW ATTITUDE</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Tami is known for her blonde curls, however, in a photo she shared at the end of last February that had more than 15 thousand likes in a short time, the actress shows <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/02/27/you-bettah-tami-roman-gives-fans-a-run-for-their-money-with-her-new-ginger-hairdo/>ginger curls </a>that match her determined new attitude.</p><p class=Fg>In the picture, Tami stands out in a black miniskirt and thigh-high boots. A long coat completes the all-black outfit. The white racing car on which she leans is the perfect background to assure and elevate her image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcnBlZnq1rcyiZKunnZa7bq7ArKKerJKWua151qKtnqtdm66usYyppqydo2Kvb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
