A few pieces of bloody clothing were in the trunk.</p><p>As for the timeline, both <a href=#>Jasmine Fiore</a> and Ryan Jenkins were seen entering her Mercedes at the San Diego Hilton at 2:30 a.m. on the morning of August 14.</p><p>Jasmine Fiore was never seen again.</p><p>Later that morning, Ryan Alexander Jenkins was seen leaving the L’Auberge Del Mar – the hotel where they were staying at in San Diego – at 9:20 a.m.</p><p>The next time he was seen on video was at 5 p.m. at his residence in Los Angeles. So where was Jasmine when Ryan was seen checking out of the L’Auberge?</p><p>Police say Ryan Jenkins possibly assaulted her in the car (where it went off road) near Corona – 96 miles north of San Diego – between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p><p>The car possibly went off road during the assault, and the area where the car went off road may be where he assaulted her more. The next day she was found in the trash. A witness saw Ryan in Buena Park near where Fiore’s body was dumped.</p><p>Another question is whether she was killed before Ryan was seen leaving the L’Auberge. Ryan could have used the “off road” area near Corona to mutilate the remains.</p><p>A prelimary report by the coroner says she was killed by strangulation. A bladed sharp instrument was used to cut her fingertips off – they don’t know what.</p><p>The severing of her fingers was definitely done post-mortem. Her nose was broken and she sustained head injuries. Pliers could have been used to pull her teeth out.</p><p>Jenkins’ suitcase – the one he left the L’Auberge with – was found in a storage facility in Washington State. Cops say one of the suitcases he left the hotel with similar in size and color to one Jasmine Fiore was found inside.</p><p>Cops say Ryan had no help from anyone in California, driving to Washington where he made his escape to Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have not been forthcoming with evidence found at the motel where he killed himself.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lxX2WFcLPRoqqlsV2iwrOwxKtkqJ5dn660ucinnGaemaS%2FpnnDnquaoZyasW6u2GanqKSZmLJuvtiapWailaO4qrrSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
