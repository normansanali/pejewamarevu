Injuries, life s–t, and just insanity in general. Ha daddy is finally back boooi!! Gonna be a fun next 10-year run,” the Step Up actor captioned a sexy snapshot via Instagram in September 2020. “To all those that have been there for me and held me down through it all. I love you. I’m gonna make ya proud. Let’s goo [sic]. Also peep the purell bottle. Keep it clean out there folks. Hahaha.”</p><p>The following month the actor shared another black-and-white photo to social media <a href=#>showcasing</a> a new look. He explained that cutting his hair after shooting a film has become a ritual over the years.</p><p>“There is nothing and I mean nothing as good as finishing the hardest job of my life,” he wrote via Instagram at the time. “And then shaving my head and letting the character go. It’s a bit of a ritual. A freeing of myself. And being free is always my highest intention. And I’m about to be sooooo freee!!! Hahahaha.”</p><p>He continued, “I have so much love in my heart for everyone that was on this journey with me. @dogthefilm and so much love for the people out there in the world that need love right now. Sending it up for all.”</p><p>Tatum was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Jenna Dewan</strong></a> from 2009 to 2018 and the couple welcomed daughter Evelyn in 2013. The actor then dated <a href=#><strong>Jessie J</strong></a> on and off until April 2020.</p><p>Following his <a href=#>split</a> from the “Bang Bang” singer, Us Weekly exclusively revealed that Tatum <a href=#>joined</a> the celebrity dating app, Raya. His profile at the time read, “And yes, I used to be a stripper. Sorry,” alongside a shrug emoji. His profile song was “Brown Sugar” by D’Angelo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Magic Mike XXL star was first linked to <a href=#><strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong></a> in summer 2021.</p><p>Scroll through to see photos of Tatum from 2006 to present day:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNksKmtzaegp59dqa61wcysZKydqK56tLTIq6ulnaOoeqO7w7Jka2hhZ391gI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
