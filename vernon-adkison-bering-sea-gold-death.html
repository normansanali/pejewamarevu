When Season 11 of Bering Sea Gold first debuted, viewers were stoked to see that Vernon Adkison was very much alive and well after rumors of his death began circulating the internet.
But as we all know, even in the world of reality TV, episodes are usually aired well after they're filmed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What we know about Vernon Adkison.</h2><p>But there's nothing to suggest that the "Wild Ranger" captain Vernon Adkison has kicked the bucket. As recently as December 25, 2019, he shared a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays message to his followers on Facebook. There aren't obituaries floating around the internet with his name on them, either, so it's safe to assume that the gold-mining, cigar-smoking, wilderness badass is alive and well.</p><p>Bering Sea Gold, like Gold Rush, fulfills that very base human desire of "hitting it big," and there really isn't any better way of satisfying that feeling than finding actual gold. Sure, there were tons of people who made a killing trading cryptocurrencies, but there aren't a bunch of reality shows about people tapping buttons on a computer screen and becoming multi-millionaires by sheer luck.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Instead, folks like Vernon have to literally mine the earth for their fortunes, a practice that many longtime BSG viewers thought he abandoned for good in 2016.</p><p>Vernon took a hiatus from television and didn't appear on Bering Sea Gold's sixth season of filming. He did, however, continue mining on his own, he just didn't feel like doing it in front of a camera for a living.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Many believe this had to do with the fact he was constantly coming up last in all of the vessels during gold mining season and he was fed up with failing time and again each and every season. He wanted to take a break from his crew's rough luck being broadcast to the entire world, or maybe his brawl with Scott Meisterheim had something to do with it?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>TMZ got exclusive video of Vernon accusing Scott of not only stealing from him, but mishandling equipment on his boat. It quickly devolved into a heated argument and the two men started trading blows. They both suffered cuts and bruises from the altercation and paramedics were called in to evaluate the two men, but neither of them pressed charges.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vernon Adkison's daughter has had some troubles with the law.</h2><p>Vernon not only had trouble on camera, either.
