What do we know about Amanda? Discover all that we know about Amanda in this article.</p><p>Cole is the star of Life Below Zero: The Next Generation.</p><h3><strong>Life Below Zero: Is Amanda Faggard Baker Cole Sturgis Wife Yet?</strong></h3><p>No, Amanda Faggard Baker is not married to Cole Sturgis — So, she is not Cole’s wife just yet. Reality Titbits claimed that the couple are engaged however there are no signs of any engagement ring or proposal on their respective socials.</p><p>The couple has been featuring each other on Facebook. The earliest they can be spotted together is in July 2023 so it is their budding relationship. Cole also specifically admits on his Facebook that he is currently in a relationship.</p><p>So, currently, Cole likely hasn’t proposed to Amanda yet and wedding plans are out of the question as of this article.</p><p>Cole himself is a father to three daughters. He home-schools his daughters and says living in Alaska is “good for the soul.” He likely had all three daughters with his ex-wife Alisha Taylor which is not confirmed.</p><p>In July 2019, Alisha posted on her FB, “When your husband (who cuts down trees for a living) gets double hernia surgery & doesn’t understand How by day three after having a major, hip to hip emergency cesarean surgery, (where they actually remove organs & then put them back in) you were walking around, going back & forth to the NICU every two hours day & night. Then after a week, having to move out of the hospital by yourself to live in a motel room, to go take care of your baby every hour for another week in the NICU. To then get home with your baby & practically go on as if life, just, must go on.”</p><p>Alisha is currently single.</p><p>Cole and his family “try to sustain on what this land around here provides us,” and “what the ocean gives us.” He also teaches his daughters survival skills in the Southeast on Life Below Zero.</p><p>Cole Sturgis, a new cast member who resides in Thorne Bay, Alaska, is featured in the clip, which you can view by using the player below. Cole’s efforts to prepare his daughters to live in the Southeast are followed throughout this season.</p><p>The popular spin-off Life Below Zero: Next Generation, which will also debut its fourth season, was born from the long-running blockbuster series, which has won eight Emmy Awards. The new season of Life Below Zero features compelling new tales of survival and resiliency in the face of Alaska’s harsh winter conditions.</p><p>While Sue Aikens’ search for caribou will be the main focus of Life Below Zero, the Next Generation ensemble is dealing with a totally different issue as dark winter approaches Alaska. This occurs during the December winter solstice when the outside light is almost nonexistent for two months. Because Alaska is so far north, where the sun rarely rises over the horizon due to its proximity to the pole, this is what occurs there.</p><p>The kids of Ricko DeWilde actively participate in their way of life. As he educates his kids about enduring customs and survival skills, DeWilde uses ravens to track Alaskan blackfish. The Hailstones adjust to unsettling changes, Andy Bassich and Denise Becker look for fresh resources on the Yukon River, and Jessie Holmes works to recuperate from a near-fatal injury.</p><p>The next generation pushes boundaries in the backcountry as the bleak winter approaches in Life Below Zero: The Next Generation. Using fortitude, Johnny Rolfe conquers the Brooks Range. The Roaches search for opportunities in new territory. In Hayes Valley, Mario and Clare pick up survival skills. On the Kenai coast, the Sarvelas contend with unusual circumstances.</p><p>Their two-story floating residence in Thorne Bay, Alaska, requires a lot of maintenance. They are surrounded by forests and water on Prince Wales Island, where there are no passing traffic. Cole said: “If you do not do the maintenance, nature will reclaim everything that was taken from it.” They also own a boat which Cole regularly goes out on to collect their daily food.</p><p>On Facebook Cole states that he works at <span class=xt0psk2>Filling The Freezer and Timber Wolf Cutting.</span></p><h3><strong>Amanda Faggard Baker Age</strong></h3><p>Amanda Faggard Baker is 36 years old as of 2023.
