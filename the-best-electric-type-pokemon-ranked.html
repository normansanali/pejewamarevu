As of&nbsp;Generation VIII, there are 61 (pure) Electric type Pokémon, but only a handful are the very best — like no one ever was.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>10. Ampharos</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-ampharos.jpg><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Introduced in Generation II, the Electric type Pokémon Ampharos evolves from Flaafy starting at level 30 and is the final evolved form of Mareep. What sets Ampharos apart from other Pokémon is its ability to&nbsp;Mega Evolve&nbsp;into&nbsp;Mega Ampharos&nbsp;using the&nbsp;Ampharosite.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Jasmine, the Gym Leader&nbsp;of&nbsp;Olivine City’s&nbsp;Gym, has an Ampharos that lights up the&nbsp;Glitter Lighthouse&nbsp;in&nbsp;Olivine City, which debuted in&nbsp;Fight for the Light! and simulatenously marked the species’ debut. Interestingly, an Ampharos appeared in the opening sequence of&nbsp;Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>9. Dedenne</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pokemon-Dedenne.jpg><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Dedenne is a dual-type Pokémon, both Electric and Fairy type, and was first introduced in Generation VI. Dedenne is not known to evolve into any other Pokémon. Sharing qualities with Pikachu, Dedenne can communicate using its whiskers, through which it transports currents of electricity. Dedenne’s upper whiskers serve as antennae that can send and receive electrical waves, allowing it to effectively communicate with others of its kind over great distances, sharing locations of food or electricity and sense its surroundings.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Its lower whiskers are organs that can fire electricity. However, Dedenne is unable to generate a lot of electricity on its own. It absorbs electricity from buildings by plugging its tail into outlets. Dedenne debuted in&nbsp;Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!, where it was seen running alongside a boy in&nbsp;Aquacorde Town. However, in the main series, Dedenne appears in Pokémon&nbsp;the Series: XY and XYZ and more specfically,&nbsp;A Battle of Aerial Mobility!, where Clemont tried to&nbsp;catch&nbsp;him for&nbsp;Bonnie&nbsp;as a partner.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>8. Morpeko</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-morpeko.jpg><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Like Dedenne, Morpeko is a dual-type Electric/Dark Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII. Morpeko is not known to evolve into any other Pokémon, but can change forms with its&nbsp;Hunger Switch&nbsp;Ability. Its two modes are known as “Full Belly” and “Hungry” mode. As another rodent-like Pokémon, Morpeko shares similarities with Pikachu and Dedenne.</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Morpeko carries around&nbsp;Berry&nbsp;seeds that have been electrically roasted in its pockets. It treats the seeds with care as if they were precious treasures, until it eats them as a snack. Regardless, it will still be hungry no matter how much it eats. By experiencing prolonged hunger, the hormones in Morpeko changes, and its fur color changes — hence the “Full Belly” and “Hungry” modes. Additionally, Morpeko is the&nbsp;only known Pokémon&nbsp;capable of learning the move&nbsp;Aura Wheel.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Morpeko debuted in both of its modes in&nbsp;Sobbing Sobble!, where it stole&nbsp;Team Rocket’s food and fled. Later, it encountered Team Rocket again and sent them blasting off with&nbsp;Aura Wheel. Shortly thereafter, Morpeko lived with the Team Rocket trio in their secret base until&nbsp;Take My Thief! Please!, where it was&nbsp;captured by James.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>7. Plusle/Minun</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-plusle-minun.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Plusle and Minun, the cheering Pokémon, are rarely seen apart. They are pure Electric types, with Plusle defined by its red markings and Minun by its blue ones. Plusle and Minun can create sparkly pom-poms by shorting out the electrical current in their palms. They use these pom-poms to cheer on their teammates and will cry loudly if they lose. Furthermore, Plusle and Minun will climb telephone poles to absorb electricity.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Plusle debuted alongside Minun in&nbsp;A Different Kind of Misty! and both Pokémon were owned by&nbsp;Thatcher, the younger brother of Alyssa, who was responsible for protecting a lighthouse. When trained as a dynamic duo, Plusle and Minun can be valuable additions to any team.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>6. Pikachu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-pikachu.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>It would be completely criminal to discuss Electric type Pokémon without including Pikachu, the co-star and mascot of the entire Pokémon franchise. Pikachu — particularly Ash’s — can be unstoppable if trained to defy any odds. It&nbsp;evolves&nbsp;from&nbsp;Pichu&nbsp;when&nbsp;leveled&nbsp;up with high&nbsp;friendship&nbsp;and evolves into&nbsp;Raichu&nbsp;when exposed to a&nbsp;Thunder Stone. Aside from being a powerful Pokémon on its own, Pikachu also has a&nbsp;Gigantamax&nbsp;form.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>As Pokémon&nbsp;has shown, wild Pikachu live in groups in&nbsp;forested areas and communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures.&nbsp;Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other&nbsp;Electric&nbsp;Pokémon species. Moreover, Pikachu is the&nbsp;only known Pokémon&nbsp;capable of using the&nbsp;Z-Move&nbsp;Catastropika.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Ash&nbsp;obtains a Pikachu&nbsp;from&nbsp;Professor Oak&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pokémon – I Choose You!, the first episode of the Pokémon anime, which also marked its debut. Ever since, Pikachu has been a constant recurring figure in the Pokémon universe, regardless of its expansion.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>5. Jolteon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-jolteon.jpg><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Jolteon evolves&nbsp;from&nbsp;Eevee&nbsp;when exposed to a&nbsp;Thunder Stone. It is one of Eevee’s&nbsp;final forms, the others being&nbsp;Vaporeon,&nbsp;Flareon,&nbsp;Espeon,&nbsp;Umbreon,&nbsp;Leafeon,&nbsp;Glaceon, and&nbsp;Sylveon. Jolteon’s prickly fur is made of electrically charged needles and generates negatively charged ions, which create a sparking noise as it moves. It also has an electricity-generating organ in its lungs.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Jolteon debuted in&nbsp;The Battling Eevee Brothers under the ownership of&nbsp;Sparky. It was targeted in one of&nbsp;Team Rocket’s schemes. In&nbsp;Trouble’s Brewing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Espeon, Not Included, Satsuki, one of the&nbsp;Kimono Sisters, owns a Jolteon. It battled&nbsp;Pikachu&nbsp;and ultimately lost after being hit with Pikachu’s&nbsp;Thunder. Kimono Girls usually appear as a quintet of Trainers who each own one of&nbsp;Eevee’s&nbsp;evolutions.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>4. Raichu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-raichu.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Just beating its previous evolution, Raichu is the final evolution of Pichu and evolves from Pikachu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. As expected, Raichu is generally more powerful than Pikachu, with the exception of Ash’s. In&nbsp;Alola, Raichu has a dual-type&nbsp;Electric/Psychic&nbsp;regional form.</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Raichu’s tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its own high voltage power. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen in the wild is because many people prefer the look it had as&nbsp;Pikachu. Like its pre-evolved forms, Raichu is able to learn&nbsp;Volt Tackle&nbsp;as a&nbsp;signature move. It is the&nbsp;only known Pokémon&nbsp;capable of using the exclusive&nbsp;Z-Move&nbsp;Stoked Sparksurfer.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In&nbsp;Electric Shock Showdown,&nbsp;Lt. Surge&nbsp;has a Raichu that defeated&nbsp;Ash’s Pikachu&nbsp;with its sheer power during&nbsp;Ash’s&nbsp;Gym&nbsp;battle.&nbsp;Ever since, Raichu has appeared several times in both its regular and regional form.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>3. Zapdos</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-zapdos.jpg><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Along with&nbsp;Articuno&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moltres, the Electric/Flying type Zapdos is one of the three&nbsp;Legendary birds&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kanto. Zapdos is not known to evolve into any other Pokémon, but in&nbsp;Galar, Zapdos has a dual-type&nbsp;Fighting/Flying&nbsp;regional form.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>When Zapdos flaps its wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms and it produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies. These are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms and gains power when struck by lightning. It is said to live among thunderclouds, but is&nbsp;rarely seen.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>In&nbsp;As Clear As Crystal, when&nbsp;Team Rocket&nbsp;made an attempt to steal a crystal that gave a lake the ability to heal&nbsp;Electric-type&nbsp;Pokémon, but they were sidetracked when a Zapdos showed up. As a result, they changed their objective to capturing Zapdos instead.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>2. Raikou</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-raikou.jpg><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Like Zapdos, Raikou is an Electric type Legendary Pokémon. Along with&nbsp;Entei&nbsp;and&nbsp;Suicune, it’s one of the Legendary beasts&nbsp;resurrected by&nbsp;Ho-Oh&nbsp;after the burning of the&nbsp;Brass Tower. It is believed that Raikou represents the lightning strike that ignited the fire that consumed the Brass Tower.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>As seen in the short animation Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs, Raikou is able to fly by creating storm clouds.&nbsp;It is shown&nbsp;to be distrustful of humans, though it may form some friendships with those who help it. Raikou tends to appear during thunderstorms and when other Electric type Pokémon are in danger. Raikou debuted in&nbsp;Houndoom’s Special Delivery, where&nbsp;Togepi&nbsp;and a&nbsp;Houndoom&nbsp;briefly spotted it before it disappeared. In&nbsp;The Legend of Thunder!,&nbsp;Team Rocket&nbsp;members&nbsp;Attila&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hun&nbsp;attempted to capture a Raikou, but failed.</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>1. Zeraora</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-zeraora.jpg><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=917 data-injectable=true>Different to a Legendary Pokémon, Zeraora is a Mythical Electric type Pokémon that was introduced in&nbsp;Generation VII&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Zeraora lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokémon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Additionally, Zeraora is the&nbsp;only known Pokémon&nbsp;capable of learning the move&nbsp;Plasma Fists.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=false>Zeraora debuted in&nbsp;the Pokémon feature film The Power of Us. Living in&nbsp;Fula City, it was once hunted down by&nbsp;Pokémon poachers&nbsp;and developed a hostility towards all humans following a fire that ravaged Fula City 50 years ago. Zeraora made its main series debut in&nbsp;Battling the Beast Within!.&nbsp;Dia, a former member of the&nbsp;Ultra Rangers, befriended it at some point prior to the episode’s events. As an exceptionally powerful and mysterious Pokémon, Zeraora tops the list.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lkprAtXnEpZycrKKesG7A2KmcZqifoLKuu81mqZqmm5qxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
