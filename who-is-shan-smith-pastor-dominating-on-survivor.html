She has remained tight with Ricard Foyé going into the merge, though fans suspect that tensions <a href=#>may flare soon</a> and we will see their friendship become a rivalry. However it goes down, Shan Smith has made for some really entertaining TV this season already, and we're excited to see her take it all the way to the end - or go down in flames. Here's everything we know about the sly, charming contender who may just take it all.</p><h2 id=yes-she-39-s-really-a-pastor><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Yes, She's Really A Pastor</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shan Smith may have a diabolical streak on the show, but in her regular life, yes, she's actually a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow SDA just outside of Washington, D.C. She has a PhD in Biblical Hebrew/Aramaic and a Masters in Divinity, which she also utilizes when she teaches workshops and intensives on reading the Bible. A course linked to her Instagram describes a program called "How to Read the Bible Like a Boss."</p><h2 id=but-she-39-s-no-stick-in-the-mud><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>...But She's No Stick In The Mud</span></h2><p>Just because she lives a devout life doesn't mean she's not wild and weird. Shan has hilarious TikTok and Instagram accounts where she had been posting comedic content long before she was considered for Survivor. Her characters and situational humor make for a great scrolling experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-in-a-gang><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Was In A Gang</span></h2><p>Fans were already connecting to Shan Smith in the first few episodes, but when she opened up to fellow contestant Liana Wallace about her childhood, they felt even more drawn to her. Shan's mom was addicted to drugs when she was growing up and wasn't around for her daughter much. Sadly, Shan got involved with some shady people and ended up in a gang. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I was homeless, I was living on the streets," she said about this time in her life.</a></p><h2 id=she-spent-time-in-foster-care><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Spent Time In Foster Care</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With no one to care for her in her mom's absence, Shan ended up in the foster care system. She hasn't shared very openly about specifics, but it was undoubtedly a difficult time in her life, during which she lost contact with her mom and didn't have many parental figures.</p><h2 id=she-39-s-done-a-lot-of-therapy-since-then><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She's Done A Lot Of Therapy Since Then</span></h2><p>Shan is proud of the hard work she's done in therapy to overcome the difficult things in her early life. <a href=#>She speaks</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> openly about that work</a>: "The accomplishment that I am MOST proud of is doing the hard work in therapy and confronting my demons, working through the pain and the feelings of injustice, and then being willing to cultivate a relationship with those who let me down when I was little."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Couples From ‘Survivor’ Are Still Together Today</a></span></p><h2 id=her-background-could-be-her-ticket-to-winning-39-survivor-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Background Could Be Her Ticket To Winning 'Survivor'</span></h2><p>When she was homeless and living on the streets, Shan Smith picked up a lot of skills that might just make her a Survivor winner.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "When you’re in that environment, you encounter a ton of different people," she said</a>. "You face a number of circumstances that most people just don’t probably face in their life, and you really learn how to read people - both cops and people who live on the streets who say that you’re friends." That certainly explains her sharp instincts and keen eye for strategy and alliances on Survivor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-lost-her-mom-tragically><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Lost Her Mom Tragically</span></h2><p>Shan Smith lost contact with her mom while she was in foster care, but they reconnected later in life and her mom was on a much better path, having gotten sober and made some positive changes for herself. Just when they were healing their relationship, though, Shan's mom passed away. Though this is sad, Shan said on the show that she's grateful that she got to have that time with her mom before she passed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"She gave me the best life she knew how and loved me with all the love she had in her. She is my image of beauty and strength,"</a> Shan said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Survivor': Fans React To Xander's Shocking Tribal Council Moment</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-felt-connected-to-jeff-probst-and-39-survivor-39-long-before-going-on-the-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Felt Connected To Jeff Probst And 'Survivor' Long Before Going On The Show</span></h2><p>Shan Smith has shared that she viewed <a href=#>Jeff Probst</a> as something like a parental figure when she was growing up and watching Survivor. "I didn’t really have a lot of parenting voices in my life," she said. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Jeff Probst kind of became that parenting voice.</a> When he encouraged the players to dig deep, those were the messages I carried with me. That eventually put myself through high school, college, grad school and doctoral work. So the show has really had a big impact on me, not just surviving, bu winning and thriving in life." We're rooting for her to win in both Survivor and in life!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Survivor': Everything We Know About Season 41 Castaway, Erika Casupanan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8eapWarnZ7BqXnPmqqtp6JisbC5yKeYraGenHqwuoysrKuumau8s3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
