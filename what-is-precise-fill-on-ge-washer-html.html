Precise Fill (also known as Auto Load Sensing) is a feature available on GE washers that include an agitator or an infusor. Precise Fill is a feature that enables the washer to identify the optimal amount of water necessary to wash the contents in the basket. When the water is being filled, Precise Fill detects the load and calculates the amount of water that will be required.
