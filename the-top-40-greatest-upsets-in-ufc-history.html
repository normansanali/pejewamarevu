No matter how dominant a fighter may appear, there is always a chance for an upset. Throughout the history of the UFC, there have been numerous shocking victories that have left fans and experts alike in awe. In this article, we will countdown the 50 biggest upsets in UFC history, highlighting the fights that defied expectations and changed the course of the sport.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>50. K.J. Noons Def. Nick Diaz Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2007, upstart promotion EliteXC created a 160-pound division and pitted Nick Diaz against K.J. Noons for the newly created title. Diaz, already a well-established fighter, was expected to easily defeat Noons and become one of the faces of the new promotion. However, Noons had other plans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>From the start of the fight, Noons landed a series of straight right hands that rocked Diaz. Despite Diaz's reputation for being tough and resilient, he couldn't withstand the barrage of punches. By the end of the first round, Diaz had massive gashes above both of his eyes, and the fight was called off. Noons shocked the world and left Diaz furious with the call.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>49. Josh Thomson Def. Gilbert Melendez Via Unanimous Decision</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In a highly anticipated battle of Bay Area lightweights, Gilbert Melendez was set to defend his Strikeforce title against Josh Thomson. Melendez was a heavy favorite, having only lost once in a competitive fight with Mitsuhiro Ishida the previous year. However, Thomson had other plans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In June of 2008, the two met in a five-round classic that saw Thomson utilize leg kicks, wrestling, and boxing to win all five rounds. To the dismay of the crowd, Thomson kept his distance in the final minutes, knowing he had already won the fight. Melendez never stopped coming forward, but it wasn't enough to secure the victory. The two would later rematch, with Melendez reclaiming his title.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>48. Kevin Burns Def. Roan Carneiro Via Second-Round Submission</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 85, Kevin Burns, an unknown fighter making his UFC debut, faced off against experienced jiu-jitsu black belt Roan Carneiro. Burns was considered a massive underdog with little chance against the American Top Team veteran.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, Burns showed his mettle by outworking Carneiro on the ground and holding his own against the decorated black belt. Halfway through the second round, Carneiro got on top, but Burns locked in a triangle choke, forcing Carneiro to tap. It was a shocking win for the relatively unknown fighter and a testament to the unpredictable nature of MMA.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>47. Pete Spratt Def. Robbie Lawler Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2003, Pete Spratt was a journeyman with a checkered resume and a 1-1 UFC record. He was expected to be another opportunity for the UFC to showcase their rising star, Robbie Lawler, who was 7-0 and trained with the same camp as Matt Hughes, the welterweight champion at the time.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 42, Spratt came out determined and sharp, using heavy leg kicks and superior athleticism to outwork the less experienced Lawler. In the middle of the second round, Lawler was forced to quit with his legs barely holding him up. Spratt's victory shocked the MMA world, but he turned down a shot at the welterweight champ, stating he wasn't ready for Hughes just yet.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>46. Jason Lambert Def. Renato Sobral Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Renato Sobral had earned himself a title shot against Chuck Liddell in the UFC, but his championship dreams were squashed after a minute and a half of an ill-advised game plan consisting of running straight at Liddell. Still, Sobral was a top ten light heavyweight and would be favored against most competition, especially Jason Lambert, who was coming off a knockout loss to Rashad Evans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>The two faced off at UFC 68, and in the second round of a fight Sobral was likely winning, they were stood up from the ground. Sobral attempted a reckless flying knee immediately after the fight restarted, but Lambert countered with a strong left hand, knocking Sobral out. It was a stunning upset that showcased the unpredictable nature of MMA.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>45. Wanderlei Silva Def. Kazushi Sakuraba Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>When Wanderlei Silva first met Kazushi Sakuraba, Silva was actually expected to lose. Sakuraba was considered by most to be the pound-for-pound best fighter in MMA at the time. However, Silva quickly recouped after being knocked down early in the fight and stopped Sakuraba with knees to the head on the ground. After the fight, Sakuraba presented Silva with his belt, and Silva offered Sakuraba a rematch.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>44. Seth Petruzelli Def. Kimbo Slice Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kimbo Slice was briefly thought to be a legitimate competitor in MMA. His aggressiveness, punching power, and massive following had him headlining EliteXC events. However, when Slice was set to take on the aging Ken Shamrock, Shamrock was forced to withdraw due to a cut, and Seth Petruzelli stepped in as a replacement.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the opening seconds of the fight, Petruzelli dropped Kimbo with a single jab to the chin, shocking the MMA world. Kimbo was stopped in just 14 seconds, and the farce of his perceived dominance was exposed. It was a stunning upset that revealed the vulnerability of even the most hyped fighters.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>43. Tim Sylvia Def. Andrei Arlovski Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 59, Andrei Arlovski was set to defend his UFC heavyweight title against Tim Sylvia in a rematch of a fight Arlovski had dominated and ended quickly one year earlier. Arlovski was the heavy favorite to keep his title, but Sylvia had other plans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Early in the round, Arlovski dropped Sylvia with a right hand, but Sylvia showed his perseverance by standing back up and landing his own right hand, dropping the champion. A few shots on the ground, and Sylvia became the UFC heavyweight champion for the second time. The two would settle their rivalry with a rubber match only a few months later, with Sylvia earning a unanimous decision victory.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>42. Chael Sonnen Def. Nate Marquardt Via Unanimous Decision</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nate Marquardt was the clear No. 1 contender for the UFC middleweight title, but he was given a fight with Chael Sonnen to stay busy until his title shot. At UFC 109, Sonnen showcased his wrestling skills, taking Marquardt down and punishing him for three rounds. Sonnen wrestled the title shot right out from under Marquardt, but in a shocking turn of events, Anderson Silva locked in a triangle choke, forcing Sonnen to tap late in the last round.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>41. Marcio Cruz Def. Frank Mir Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2004, Frank Mir was the UFC heavyweight champion, but a motorcycle accident left him with a broken femur and torn ligaments in his knee. In 2006, Mir made his return to the Octagon against 1-0 Marcio Cruz. Mir looked sluggish and out of shape, and shockingly, he was stopped by strikes in the first round. It would be a few years before Mir regained his form, while Cruz never won in the UFC again.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>40. Brett Rogers Def. Andrei Arlovski Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Andrei Arlovski had recently been knocked out in the first round by Fedor Emelianenko, but he was still considered to be on a higher level than the less experienced Brett Rogers. However, Rogers charged at Arlovski in the opening seconds, landing a hard right hand that forced the referee to stop the bout at just 22 seconds. Rogers used this win to secure a match against Fedor Emelianenko.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>39. Nick Diaz Def. Robbie Lawler Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2004, many believed Robbie Lawler would become the next UFC welterweight champion. When he faced Nick Diaz at UFC 47, it was assumed that Diaz would be left unconscious if the fight didn't go to the ground. However, Diaz surprised everyone by forcing a stand-up battle. Diaz landed a right hook from his southpaw stance in the middle of the second round, putting Lawler down and prompting the referee to call off the fight. The win put Diaz on the MMA map and showcased his striking skills.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>38. Paulo Thiago Def. Josh Koscheck Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Just two months after a devastating first-round knockout of Yoshiyuki Yoshida, Josh Koscheck faced unheralded newcomer Paulo Thiago. Koscheck appeared frustrated to be facing such an unknown fighter, but he was still a huge favorite over Thiago at UFC 95. However, Thiago caught Koscheck with a right uppercut that left him dazed and falling to the ground. The referee quickly jumped in and stopped the fight, giving Thiago a shocking upset victory.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>37. Jens Pulver Def. B.J. Penn Via Majority Decision</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>B.J. Penn began his career with three spectacular early first-round knockouts and was considered unbeatable. He was given a title shot against lightweight champion Jens Pulver, who was the underdog in the fight. Pulver survived Penn's early attacks and went on to win the last three rounds, retaining his title. Pulver would later lose a rematch against Penn in 2007.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>36. Rashad Evans Def. Chuck Liddell Via Second-Round KO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2008, Rashad Evans faced off against the legendary Chuck Liddell. Most fans and experts expected Liddell to knock out Evans, but a shocking right hand from Evans dropped Liddell midway through the second round. The once-indestructible champion was left unconscious on the mat, and Evans used this victory to propel himself to a shot at the light heavyweight title, which he won.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>35. Mark Coleman Def. Stephan Bonnar Via Unanimous Decision</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mark Coleman, the first-ever UFC heavyweight champion, had not achieved a victory in the promotion for almost ten years. At UFC 100, he faced Stephan Bonnar, known for his historic fight with Forrest Griffin in the finals of the first season of The Ultimate Fighter. Coleman used his wrestling to control Bonnar and punished him with punches on the ground, earning a unanimous decision victory. It was one of the highlights of the monumental event.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>34. Pete Williams Def. Mark Coleman Via Overtime KO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 17, former heavyweight champion Mark Coleman was scheduled to face current champ Randy Couture in the main event. However, when Couture withdrew due to a training injury, he was replaced by Pete Williams, who was making his UFC debut. After a long first round that saw Coleman punish Williams on the ground, the fighters went into a three-minute overtime. Coleman was exhausted, and Williams took advantage by landing a barrage of punches and throwing a right head kick. Coleman ducked right into the kick and was immediately knocked out, resulting in one of the UFC's first head kick knockout highlights.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>33. Frank Mir Def. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Frank Mir faced Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, considered one of the best heavyweights in MMA history. While Nogueira was the favorite, Mir showcased his improved striking and dropped Nogueira multiple times. In the second round, Mir finished Nogueira with punches on the ground, becoming the first fighter to stop the legendary Nogueira. It was a defining moment in Mir's career and showed that even the most revered fighters can be vulnerable.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>This is just the beginning of our countdown of the 50 biggest upsets in UFC history.
