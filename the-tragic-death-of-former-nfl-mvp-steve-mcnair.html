As reporter Erik Bacharach wrote, "What you saw was what you got. A family man. A faithful man. A community-oriented and generous leader of a man." But the murder-suicide that ended his life revealed a different side of the former MVP, "one that was more susceptible to temptation."&nbsp;</p><p>McNair's running back Eddie George <a href=#>told CNN</a> that the former quarterback struggled to fill a void that opened up within him after he left the <a href=#>NFL</a>. "What people fail to realize is that when you make a transition away from the game — emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually — you go through something. You change, and you're constantly searching for something," he said, adding that the situation was in no way unique to McNair. "I just know from experience that when you're used to doing something for so long that you love to do — how do you fill that void? You're in search of something. Most players may go back to things they used to know. They may revert back to drugs, divorce rates go up, obesity. You're looking for something comforting." Still, he and others hope that McNair's legacy will ultimately be about the game and the good he did with his life. "I'm hoping that people can look beyond the circumstances surrounding his death," George said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlHBoa2pfqbWmedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSonl2bvLO5xKtkp56cYrq3vIysq56ulWK6pLrAoqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
