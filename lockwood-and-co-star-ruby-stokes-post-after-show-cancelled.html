It was a chance to explore a very different character and I’ve learned a great deal playing a young adult at the helm of a show. I just felt it was an opportunity I couldn’t turn down!"</p><p id=eA1AiXvzVmA data-wc=30>However, Ruby has a seriously exciting series in the works alongside Samantha Morton.
