Raised in a middle-class household, his mom, Nereida Morales, worked as an accountant, while dad&nbsp;Enrique Martín Negroni was a psychologist. Despite his parents' analytical professions, Martin was drawn to creative pursuits. The entertainment bug bit him from a young age; as a child, he loved entertaining people and would perform plays for strangers on the street. Soon enough, however, he landed his first acting gigs and began appearing in commercials.</p><p dir=ltr>His debut professional appearance was in an ad for Orange Crush, followed by a Burger King commercial. Appearing on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" in 2020 (via <a href=#>Out</a>), Martin revealed that it was his cousin who auditioned for the soda commercial; he just accompanied him. However, the casting team recognized Martin's star quality and went with him instead. "But it's ok, it happens!" he joked. "We love each other, it's all good."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Both of these ads aired in the mainland United States, which helped to introduce the tween to the North American market. As Martin recalled to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, appearing in the aforementioned commercials led to him becoming a tad cocky. "It was good money: $1,600 the first day and residuals every six months," he said. "After that I said, 'Dad, I want to become independent.' He was like, 'What are you talking about?' 'Well, now I have money, I can pay for my school and books, and I want a bicycle.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmloZ4Fye9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd50aKapLFdoq6zwMinZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
