Bio</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-11</div><p><strong>Riley Norah Tracy </strong>is the daughter of <strong>Norah O'Donnell</strong>, a journalist and a news presenter for <i>CBS News</i>. She is liked by many for how she presents herself and reports the news. And she credits that to her inner military values for that, as she and her sister Mary O'Donnell grew up in a military family.</p><p>Riley is the youngest of the three kids O'Donnell shares with her husband, Geoff Tracy, who is a chef. Her other two siblings are sister Grace Tracy and brother Henry Tracy. Let's learn a bit about her.</p><h2>Riley Norah Tracy Mother: Who Is Norah O'Donnell's Husband?&nbsp;</h2><p>Riley Norah Tracy's mother, Norah O'Donnell, is married to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Geoff Tracy</a> as the two walked down the aisle on <strong>June 9, 2001</strong>. The lovely couple first met at Georgetown University as freshmen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/10/321084795_553808879614669_6377982873503494963_n%20(2)-1673372687939.jpg><p>Fast forward three decades later, and their marriage is still going strong.&nbsp;Riley's mother, O'Donnell, doesn't shy away from praising her loving husband. She has praised him for being a family man and credited Tracy's parents for raising him well.</p><h2>Riley's Parent's Net Worth</h2><p>Riley Norah Tracy's mother, Norah O'Donnell, has a net worth of <strong>$22 Million</strong>. On the other hand, her father, Geoff Tracy, has a net worth of <strong>$8 Million</strong>. Her mother is the biggest bread earner in the house, and it's no surprise since she is the famous one in Riley's family.</p><p>O'Donnell's revenue source is<i> CBS News</i>. She is the face of the program <i>CBS Evening News </i>and works as an anchor and a managing editor on the show. It is one of the network's top-rated shows, and her annual salary exceeds <strong>$3 Million</strong>. Her other sources of income (if there are any) remain undisclosed.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell's husband, Geoff Tracy, works as a chef. Not only he works, but he also owns a company called Chef Geoff's Restaurant Group. The group includes two restaurants, Chef Geoff's West End and Chef Geoff's. Both are located in Washington, DC, and are hugely popular. This is his revenue source.</p><h2>Has Twin Siblings</h2><p>Riley has twin siblings, <strong>Grace Tracy</strong> and<strong> Henry Tracy</strong>. Grace and Henry are her elder sisters and brothers of hers, respectively. The 2008-born Riley is a year younger than her twin siblings, who were born on <strong>May 18, 2007</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/10/323870296_212412987810792_6613107625763437402_n%20(1)-1673372717357.jpg><p>Grace is a minute older than her brother Henry. O'Donnell often shares pictures of her kids on her Instagram, where they can be seen having fun with each other. There is a lot of love between the brothers and sisters.</p><h2>Who Is Norah O'Donnell's Sister?</h2><p>Norah O'Donnell's daughter Riley Norah Tracy's aunt is <strong>Mary O'Donnell</strong>, who is currently serving in the military. Mary is based in Bethesda, Maryland, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. She serves as the chief of colon and rectal surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary was probably inspired by her father, Col. Francis O'Donnell, to join the military as his father used to be part of it. His job was also kind of similar in the sense that he was also involved in the health department. He served as a physician in the military.</p><h2>Tim Russert Gave Riley Her Name</h2><p>The late TV personality Tim Russert put forward the name of Norah O'Donnell's youngest daughter, Riley Norah Tracy. He was the one to suggest the name of her newborn baby daughter be Riley. This is a sad story, as Russert sadly left this world just three weeks before July 5, 2008. In other words, the day Riley was born.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/10/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1)%20(1)-1673373077498.jpg><p>Russert passed away on <strong>June 13, 2008</strong>, and O'Donnell was heartbroken by the news. They were very good friends with each other. The story of Russert suggesting Riley's name was brought to the media's attention by <i>CBS News</i> Norah herself. She brought it up while speaking at the Donor event organized by the Campaign for Catholic Schools, as reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Boston Business Journal</i></a><i>.</i></p><h2>Raising Riley Was Difficult For O-Donnell Alone</h2><p><i>CBS</i> <i>News </i>anchor Norah&nbsp;has openly talked about how difficult it was for her to grow up a Riley and her other two kids. Since she is the youngest of the three, she is the toughest one to take care of. And it would have been hard for her to take care of her kids alone, but thankfully, she had Riley's grandparents to help her.</p><p>Riley is still young, but her mother, Norah, has grown old enough that she doesn't need to be constantly looked at. The<i> CBS Evening News</i> anchor brought this whole story to light at another <i>CBS </i>show, the <i>Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson</i>. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>People</i></a><i> </i>have covered this story.</p><h2>About Riley's Mother, Norah O'Donnell</h2><p>Norah O'Donnell is a respected name in American Journalism. She works for <i>CBS</i>, and her show <i>CBS Evening News</i>, where <a href=# rel=nofollow>Manuel Bojorquez</a> works as a correspondent, is liked by many. She is loved by many for the way she presents the news on the show.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Norah's credibility as a journalist is secured by her Emmy Award for <i>Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story.</i> Apart from that, she has also been nominated for several other Emmy Awards. Nine, to be precise.</p><p>Besides presenting news on television, Norah&nbsp;is also occupied with her writing. She is also an author and is responsible for books like <i>Baby Love: Healthy, Easy, Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler.</i></p><h2>Norah&nbsp;Is A Skin Cancer Survivor</h2><p>Riley's mother, Norah O'Donnell, is a skin <strong>cancer survivor</strong>. She suffered from Melanoma, considered one of the worst forms of skin cancer. She was first diagnosed with it in <strong>November 2016</strong> and had surgery to get rid of it. Thankfully, she is cancer-free today and more involved in teaching and making me aware of the disease.</p><p>One of the things Norah&nbsp;constantly focuses on while talking about cancer is tanning. Tanning has become a trend among people, and O'Donnell herself has been guilty of trying to tan her body in the past. Tanning is one of the biggest reasons for the development of Melanoma in the human body, and she is doing everything in her power to make sure people recognize the threat of it.</p><h2>Norah Controversy For Calling Trump A Liar</h2><p>Norah&nbsp;found herself in controversy for calling former US President Trump a liar for one of his claims. The story begins with the FBI taking Donald Trump's passport and keeping it to themselves for a week. She tweeted on Twitter that the incident had never occurred and the President was lying. But not too long later, it was discovered that the FBI had taken the passport for a brief period.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/10/download%20(1)-1673373473308.jpg><p>People trolled Norah&nbsp;mercilessly for this. Some questioned her intelligence, while others even questioned her credibility as a journalist as she tweeted about what she heard without even bothering to fact-check it. It left a huge stain on her career; some even stopped taking her seriously.</p><p><i>If you liked Riley Norah Tracy's bio, then we have more exciting bios for you to read here at </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqugpZ2pYruwvsChZK2qkZjG</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
