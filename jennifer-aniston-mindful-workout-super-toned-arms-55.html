"Jennifer recently revealed that she has turned towards low-intensity, more mindful workouts, partially to avoid injury but also to take the pressure and stress off her body."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston, 55, looks incredible in sheer top as she shares the secret to her silky hair" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ec87f6ce803f-jennifer-aniston-hair.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston, 55, looks incredible in sheer top as she shares the secret to her silky hair" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jennifer Aniston, 55, looks incredible in sheer top as she shares the secret to her silky hair</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's viral 15-15-15 workout builds 'strength and endurance' for over 50s" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/97b66251e263-gettyimages-1934023657.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's viral 15-15-15 workout builds 'strength and endurance' for over 50s" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jennifer Aniston's viral 15-15-15 workout builds 'strength and endurance' for over 50s</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=evWawrQvHws data-wc=82>Martyn reveals it is a certain kind of workout which Jennifer has turned to, and it's one which can be recreated by her fans. "Pvolve, which is endorsed by Jenifer Anniston, is a low-impact form of resistance training which uses patented resistance equipment in partnership with a range of stretches to help target muscle groups, improving flexibility, mobility and balance," the expert explains. "It is suitable for older women in particular as it is accessible for those who are pre or post-menopausal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c18398fca9aa-jennifer-aniston-abs.png><h2 dir=ltr>What is the key to toned arms?</h2><p id=ewrb9hGTPM_ data-wc=47>Martyn reminds us that simply focusing on your arms and not working out any other area of your body will not lead to the strength Jennifer has built, saying that the idea that you can target one area when it comes to fat loss is a myth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/554f4339a99c-pilaes.jpg><p id=eTz9jAnXtCL data-wc=45>"Resistance training will help you build muscle if done alongside progressive overload, slowly building up the weight you use when training. If you're not keen on the idea of weight training, Pilates and yoga are also options that can help you build strength," he explains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f94f1ecea4d2-gettyimages-1934023165.jpg><p id=e4QMssupXZX data-wc=39>"If fat loss is also a goal of yours, pair these workouts with cardiovascular workouts," Martyn adds. These don’t need to be intense like HIIT or running, it can be as simple as getting out on a daily walk."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Is arm day worth it?</h2><p id=eWMSbgVlyy_ data-wc=72>So how do you decide how to factor arm workouts into your schedule, and is a dedicated weekly 'arm day' the solution? "If you can only make it to the gym three times a week, I would suggest doing three full-body workouts that cover all muscle groups," Martyn tells us. "To ensure you're not doing super long workouts though, try and incorporate compound movements that target multiple muscle groups at a time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b0681e86a74-wellness-apps.jpg><p id=eiGTINNbD8C data-wc=59>"Alternatively, you could split these exercises into isolated workouts, focusing one day on the upper body, one day on the lower body, and then finish the week with a full-body workout," he says. "If you’re looking at Pilates and yoga, you can do specific workouts targeting certain areas, but many online workouts within these generally cover all muscle groups."</p><h2 dir=ltr>What are some recommended upper-body workouts?</h2><p id=eEHxKZWyOn3 data-wc=75>Many are at a loss when it comes to where to start - but Martyn is on hand to help. "If you are looking to build an upper body-focused routine, or want to add more arm-focus moves to your full body routine, look at combining resistance training movements such as tricep dips or tricep extensions, bicep or hammer curls, overhead or shoulder presses, planks with shoulder taps, lateral raises, front raises and push-ups," he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd608a4de4ab-shutterstock2362139093.jpg><p id=e9_nsow43fr data-wc=56>"All of these workouts can be done without weights if you're just starting out, but as you gain strength, be sure to add weights slowly to ensure you’re building muscle effectively. It's a common misconception that you need to do as many moves as possible in your workouts, five to six movements per workout is enough."</p><h2 dir=ltr>What other lifestyle choices can contribute towards toned arms?</h2><p id=efKzXWY5GPjO data-wc=67>It won't come as a surprise that building a toned physique like Jennifer's is not down to exercise alone. Martyn recommends a protein-rich diet and reducing the amount of processed and sugary foods. However, he does remind us not to fall into the trap of removing food groups unless advised to do so by a medical professional as restricted diets generally aren't effective as they're not sustainable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98b30860a313-jen-aniston-gym.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What equipment is needed for a beginner looking for toned arms?</h2><p id=eiTIdqM0dmRo data-wc=52>You may worry that you don't have the same budget as a Hollywood A-lister when it comes to investing in exercise equipment but fret not - you don't have to part with too many pennies. Jennifer's go-to workouts can even be done at home with just a few key pieces of equipment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ec2e3c93a7c0-reese-witherspoon-jen-an.jpg><p id=eVxUhqT0TK3q data-wc=32>"Start off by incorporating bodyweight exercises into your schedule three times a week," Martyn says, adding that a decent pair of supportive trainers can help to ensure proper form and prevent injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e90370ab9839-jennifer-aniston-black-pants.jpg><p id=ebu7d2OSNr_Z data-wc=25>"As you progress, then you can look at incorporating weights and resistance to your exercises and introduce this with dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells or resistance bands."</p><h2 dir=ltr>After how long should you expect to see results from arm workouts?</h2><p id=eU1Z8bEVgE6P data-wc=43>Like any health journey, results are individualised. But Martyn does say that if you are consistent with your workouts and nutrition you should expect to start feeling a change within four to six weeks, with bigger changes being felt within eight to twelve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/874c39d1ac56-gettyimages-2028792361.jpg><p id=eyKIKHCi-P data-wc=17><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>12 celebrities who swear by therapy for their mental health: Jennifer Aniston, Meghan Markle & more&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
