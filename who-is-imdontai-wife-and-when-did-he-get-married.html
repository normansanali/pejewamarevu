In the year 2020, the American social media sensation and gamer married Danielle. The pair has been married for a few years and is set to welcome a child into their family.</strong></p><p>During the coronavirus outbreak that decimated the United States, ImDontai and Danielle married. They couldn’t hold a lavish ceremony because of this. Despite this, their wedding was a success, and they are currently living happily ever after.</p><h2><span id=Is_ImDontai_Getting_Married>Is ImDontai Getting Married?</span></h2><p>Yes, ImDontai, real name Dante Anthony Etheridge, has long shed his bachelorhood and married. Prior to 2020, the social media content producer was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors among male social media stars, and his marital status was hotly contested among his fans.</p><p>According to the social media sensation, he planned to marry a long time ago but had to cope with some hurdles owing to the woman he wanted to marry greatly delaying his preparations.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_ImDontais_Wife>Who Is ImDontai’s Wife?</span></h2><p>Danielle has never been well-known. As a result, no information regarding her life or family background has ever been made public. In contrast, Imdontai’s wife rose to popularity as the wife of one of America’s most popular content developers. She has made it clear that she prefers to live her life away from the prying eyes of the media and the general public.</p><p>However, it has lately been revealed that the celebrity wife is also a social media influencer, although an unwilling one. Her Instagram page has over 100k followers, and she has published a good number of posts.</p><h2><span id=ImDontai_met_his_wife_in_what_way>ImDontai met his wife in what way?</span></h2><p>ImDontai has been dating a woman simply known as Danielle since his childhood, according to information obtained from web sources. As a result, determining the precise day on which the two first met is challenging. However, we were told that Danielle was only 10 years old when they met.</p><p>The American video creator and gamer recounted how they met on Facebook and how he first asked her out on a date using his Facebook account during a Twitch question-and-answer session regarding his dating era with Danielle. He received a favorable answer.</p><p>Dante Anthony Etheridge and his love interest are also classmates. The YouTuber and content producer shared a story about their time as classmates at the same school. Accompanying each other to school helped bring the two closer, and they rapidly became inseparable.</p><h2><span id=Whats_The_Relationship_Between_ImDontai_and_Danielle>What’s The Relationship Between ImDontai and Danielle</span></h2><p>According to prior accounts, ImDontai and his love interest dated for nine long years before splitting up. When asked why their wedding had been rescheduled, the American internet sensation blamed his wife, Danielle. Dante Anthony Etheridge described in his own words how he was eager to walk down the aisle with his love interest but was forced to wait.</p><p>Danielle was anxious about being married, according to ImDontai, because she has always been uncomfortable taking center stage in any ceremony. As a result, she avoided it because the bride was always the focus of attention at any wedding, but he persisted. When Danielle eventually responded yes to Dante’s repeated marriage proposal, Dante’s anxiousness was passed to him.</p><p>The YouTube sensation claims that seeing Danielle in her wedding gown for the first time caused his heart to rush at a breakneck pace. He reasoned that she had kept him waiting for an extended period of time. As a result, it was difficult to accept that it had finally happened.</p><p>The specific date of ImDontai and Danielle’s wedding has always escaped the media and the general public, but according to some online sources, the couple exchanged wedding vows in August 2020. Remember that the coronavirus epidemic peaked in the United States in 2020. As a result, it goes without saying that the couple was stressed out while organizing their wedding.</p><h2><span id=ImDontai>ImDontai</span></h2><p>Dante was forced to alter their wedding date numerous times as the virus decimated America, which he was unwilling to do given how long he had waited. They also had to take into account the COVID-19 requirements for large crowd meetings, which required them to cut their invitation list in confirmation.</p><p>ImDontai and Danielle ultimately pared down their family and close friends list. They had a successful wedding, and the lovebirds described the day as exciting as it was joyous. For example, Danielle described it as a day filled with love and good sentiments.</p><h2><span id=ImDontais_Married>ImDontai’s Married</span></h2><p>The couple has been married for two years, from August 2020 to the present. Despite the fact that Danielle tends to want to stay out of the spotlight, she appears on ImDontai’s YouTube channel on occasion. Needless to say, whenever she shows up there, all of their conversations would naturally focus on their married life.</p><p>Dante, for example, has spoken extensively about marriage, and the American content creator appears to be happily married. He didn’t waste time releasing video highlights from their wedding ceremony, which he labeled “The Best Day Of My Life.” The video has gained over 1.3 million views and continues to climb.</p><p>Dante clearly adores his wife, as evidenced by the inclusion of her name in his Instagram bio. The pair does not yet have any children, but according to sources, Danielle miscarried her first pregnancy, but Dante’s Instagram handle suggests that another child is on the way.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
