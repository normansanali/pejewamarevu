Following this, she has constantly tried to undermine Helen's authority and knowledge.</p><p>In the most recently aired Season 2 Episode 8 of 'New Amsterdam', we saw her throwing Helen under the bus with the board. As we saw, in an attempt to help a patient with immense pain, Helen took her to an illegal yet clean joint where she could ingest heroin without fearing any diseases.</p><p>Despite her good intentions, she was arrested and even though Valentina bailed her out, she ensured that the people higher up knew about it.</p><p>Even though Valentina claimed to have no ill intentions in involving the board, it is clear that she wanted the board to know and hoped that this new development will allow her to be the full chair of the Oncology department, rather than half.</p><p>This would not only boost her ego but would also allow her to do whatever she wants without having to consult with Helen or get her approval.</p><p>In the upcoming Season 2 Episode 9 of 'New Amsterdam', we will see Helen and max busy going up against a dangerous prison in an attempt to protect the inmates from completely avoidable diseases.</p><p>However, Helen's career will still be a priority, especially for Max who doesn't know her arrangement with Valentina. Once he does, he is sure to turn things around at the New Amsterdam Oncology department.</p><p>'The Island', which marks Season 2 Episode 9 of 'New Amsterdam' will air on Tuesday, November 19, on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppWseqK50q2cq5yRonq0scCspqdlYmKysbXSqJueZWliw6K4xKeroqaRYrCiv9OrpmaskZjBqq%2FSZqqinJWhtq%2BxjKGcpZ2eYsCprdGpnGavn6e4brnAsWRscGlpf3g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
