"But I'm not just a nut." It might seem a slightly odd way to define oneself, but in the case of this much-loved New York funnyman the description seems to fit perfectly.</p><p id=ezBPTeOmFSl data-wc=49>The charmingly bedraggled comic has carved out a niche playing world-weary, wise-cracking anti-heroes, but has also proved he's capable of much more. In Mad Dog And Glory he turned in a remarkable performance as a heartless gangster, while Lost In Translation has confirmed his reputation as a character actor.</p><p id=e13pKF_bWge data-wc=69>Some may say he is not blessed with leading man looks, but Bill might be more inclined to think he's not burdened by them. Always anxious to avoid following formulas or becoming predictable, the actor is largely uninterested in Hollywood's definition of success. But there's no questioning that he has enjoyed moments of box office glory, too; most notably when 1984's stormed cinema charts all over the world.</p><p id=eu3mozpXeeS data-wc=30>The film was the latest of a series of collaborations with Ivan Reitman and Harold Ramis, who helped him make his first forays into cinema with comedies Caddyshack and Meatballs.</p><h2>Bill Murray's early career</h2><p id=eDaJtRlft6N data-wc=109>It was in television, however, that the wry performer first made his name. Having worked with Dan Ackroyd and the legendary John Belushi on the National Lampoon Radio Hour, he became a regular member of the Saturday Night Live team in 1975. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bill had never been a stand-up comic. His talent for comedy acting was outstanding nonetheless, and offers of movie work soon started coming in. In the years since he has delivered some of the big screen's most hilarious characters, including the maniacal tycoon in Scrooged, a pain-loving dental patient in Little Shop Of Horrors and a hopeless neurotic in What About Bob.</p><p id=ezPDdCM8ngk data-wc=81>There is also a more serious side to the performer, however. After his first attempt at writing a screenplay 1984's Razor's Edge was met with a frosty critical reception, the actor turned his back on Tinseltown to study philosophy and history at the Sorbonne. A passion for learning was matched by a love of sport, and the die-hard New York Mets fan owns one minor baseball league team and part-owns three more. But his greatest affection is reserved for his family.</p><p id=etmqzgwSHog data-wc=95>Born in Wilmette, Illinois, on September 21, 1950, Bill is the fifth of nine children and went on to have six of his own. The actor's dedication to his loved ones was underlined when he won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor. Working on a new film in Italy at the time, but determined to share his special moment with his family, the performer chartered a private plane so he could pick up his then-wife Jennifer Butler in New York en route to the LA ceremony, before jetting back to Europe the following day.</p><p id=epmcVYCcSH- data-wc=113>The trip reportedly cost $180,000, but Bill was adamant that Jennifer be at his side for the prize giving. Although he was clearly honoured to receive the gong, awards are not what motivates Bill. The droll performer insists Tinseltown glory is overrated - though he does appreciate the competitive rates of pay. "I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: 'Try being rich first'," he explained previously, adding: "See if that doesn't cover most of it. There's not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job."</p><p id=egW9bAcG0ch data-wc=44>In 2008, Jennifer and Bill filed for divorce. Jennifer passed away in January 2021. His first wife was Margaret Kelly, whom he married in 1981. They welcomed two sons, Homer and Luke. With Jennifer, Bill welcomed another four sons: Caleb, Jackson, Cooper and Lincoln.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ta2lkr6q4y2akrqqilsZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
