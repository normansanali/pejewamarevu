It turns out that he has a specific checklist for potential partners, and his current girlfriend ticks all the boxes.</p><h2 id=mrbeast-and-his-girlfriend-met-in-south-africa>MrBeast And His Girlfriend Met In South Africa</h2><p>MrBeast recently went on an Antarctica expedition with his friends and YouTube crew to film a 50-hour challenge video. But it was not their first attempt going there, he said in the podcast.</p><p>The first trip got canceled because every single person in the Antarctica base tested positive for Covid. So they all had to be med-evaced out.</p><p>“We were about to board the plane and fly out and do 50 hours in Antarctica. And now it's a wasteland. There's no one there to clear off the ice runway or anything.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="YouTube Star MrBeast's Net Worth Is Insane, But He Plans To Continue Giving It All Away">YouTube Star MrBeast's Net Worth Is Insane, But He Plans To Continue Giving It All Away</a></span></p><p>So they spent a few days chilling in South Africa instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And on one of those days, they were at a friend's place having dinner when a friend of the friend decided to join them for a short while.</p><p>That girl eventually became MrBeast's girlfriend.</p><h2 id=mrbeast-39-s-girlfriend-is-a-published-author>MrBeast's Girlfriend Is A Published Author</h2><p>When this friend of his friend walked in, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MrBeast was immediately gobsmacked</a>.</p><p>“I was like holy sh*t this girl is beautiful,” he said. “But I have to go through the test.”</p><p>He elaborated that he doesn't get along with women if they don't love learning and don't have a hobby.</p><p>There's just certain things where if you have these traits we'll get along really well, and if you don't it's impossible for us to hang out... So I had to put her through the ringer and start asking questions.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>He asked her what she did. She said she was an author.</p><p>And then they talked more and he discovered she has multiple degrees and loves watching documentaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, his girlfriend is currently getting a Neuropsychology degree just for fun. Mainly because, like a lot of other people, <a href=#>including celebrities who invested in crypto and Bitcoin</a>, MrBeast's girlfriend also 'invested in crypto and did really well.'</p><p>“So she doesn't even need [a job]. “</p><h2 id=mrbeast-flew-to-south-africa-every-few-weeks-to-meet-her>MrBeast Flew To South Africa Every Few Weeks To Meet Her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-26.jpg><p>Since he broke up with his ex-girlfriend and before he met his current girlfriend, MrBeast had put 40 different girls through the same test (in his head, of course, it would be obnoxious otherwise).</p><p>“I had these 10 things that if I meet a girl who's beautiful and they have these 10 traits, we're gonna be literally best friends. She [his girlfriend] checked every single one of them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the problem was he lives in the United States and she is in South Africa. And they could only spend 20 minutes hanging out the first time before he had to fly back.</p><p>So he found excuses to speak to her. Even asking her to send him her book so he could read it before he decided to fly to South Africa again just to meet her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is MrBeast Really Unproblematic?

Even a tourist visa can take up to two years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So they found a website where you could book a visa appointment if someone canceled theirs. And then they hired someone to refresh the website all day long and book a slot if one opened up.</p><p>Long story short, MrBeast's girlfriend was able to fly to North Carolina (where MrBeast lives) much sooner.</p><h2 id=who-is-mrbeast-39-s-girlfriend>Who Is MrBeast's Girlfriend?</h2><p><a href=#>MrBeast's girlfriend is Thea Booysen</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was born and raised in Cape Town</a>, South Africa, and is a Twitch streamer with 24,000 followers on the platform. She mainly plays games, like The Witcher, on her channel and goes by the online name 'TheaBeasty'.</p><p>She is also the author of YA novel The Marked Children. Although it's not very well known and hasn't made her a fortune, unlike some other influencers and <a href=#>sitcom stars who made a fortune after their book got onto the NYT bestseller list</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/thea-booysen-youtube.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I knew of MrBeast.
