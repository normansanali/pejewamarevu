Most of the members have their own followings in games like Apex Legends, Rocket League, Call of Duty, and others in addition to Fortnite. Their impressive roster of players has made them a huge competitor in the esports game.</p><p>It's no secret that NRG has quickly picked up many of the best Fortnite players out there right now. To consolidate that talent, the group has now put their best players in one house, forming the gaming collective. NRG Esports just introduced viewers to their Season 1 players, with some membership changes when Season 2 begins next month. NRG is already talking about expanding the house's members based on their success this season.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about the current Fortnite House members.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clix</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>15-year-old Cody, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clix</a> online, is a professional Fortnite gamer, and one of the Fortnite House's first members.

With more than 560,000 followers on Twitch, Fortnite is Ron's primary game of choice. While Ron may not have the stats that some of his other NRG Esports members have, he's arguably one of the best players in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>But he's not just known for his Fortnite skills. In fact, Ron's streams are best identified by their horrible microphone quality, which has become a running joke among his viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Unknown</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Best caption in the comments goes on my storyðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dominick Green</a> (@nrg_unknown) on Jul 11, 2020 at 2:24pm PDT</p></figure><p>Dominick "Unknown" Green was another Fortnite player quickly snatched up by NRG Esports.
