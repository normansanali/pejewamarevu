"Lil @misstokyotoni ain't want no smoke after she realized I ain't no joke. I'm @olsokcy @kaliwae & @bluefasebabyy mamma. You couldn't have possibly thought because I'm an actress, I'm punk. They get it from they mammy," Saffold wrote on Instagram. It's unclear what Saffold is directly responding to.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, it's not the first time this month that the pair have butted heads. After Tokyo Toni went after <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a> and Blue Ivy, Saffold came to the mother-daughter duo's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">defense</a>. "Girl, if you don't stop messing with Blue Ivy! She is proving the Black children early work ethics through generational talent. Don't discourage her because she ain't out here getting pregnant and waiting to be nobody baby momma like us. Don't do her," Saffold argued.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Toyko Toni is starting to make a habit of viral rants. On Thanksgiving, she went off on such a tangent that Blac Chyna, her daughter, had to dip. Chyna and Toni had been on a calling together when Toni began ranting about transgender people and "letting people be who they want to be". After giving an example from their only family, Toni abruptly changed topics to attack Gates. "There's a lot of freaky people out there, like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kevin Gates</a>. He got two wives and a he got a big butt." A thoroughly confused Chyna left the call but Toni just kept going. "I just found he's from Morocco. That is their religion."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, Toni is no stranger to just spouting off out-of-pocket about people. In September, Toni took to Instagram to diss <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Beyonce</a> in a freestyle. "She got all this f-cking money. She got y'all looking f-cking dumb. Who the f-ck gon pay that money anyway. For a bad man's b-tch who use a fan all day? Stop the fan, two things gon happen. The b-tch gon turn into a jackal. She gotta keep that f-cking demon down. She keep that hair flowing, pounds. It's crazy as sh-t, round for round. Costumes on, what the f-ck she got on her f-cking page? Costumes…from early age? What the f-ck she got that wilda-- voodoo sh-t," Toni rapped.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
