The odds were stacked against her for years… decades.. and she fought so hard and won for soooo long. “Melissa Courchain lit up a room with her dancing, wiggles and laugh. Despite her condition, she was an amazing ATHLETE! A singer and dancer. I played field hockey and softball with her from middle school days through high school. She was an amazing wife to her husband Bob and a momma to little Austin. I knew her family well back in the day. She also had an epic group of girlfriends that have all been friends since they were children, and still are to this day.<br>“I’m sad to be so far away during this hard time. I wish I could hug and cry with everyone.<br>Please stay tuned to how you can help the family in the coming days and weeks. Support platforms are in the works as I type this.
