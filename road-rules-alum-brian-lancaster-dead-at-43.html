Bell; his parents, Dennis and Carol Lancaster; his godparents, Ed Lancaster and Janice O’Hara; and his dog, Reagan.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Private memorial services will be held on Thursday, April 5.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, Lancaster’s family has asked that contributions be made in his name to <a href=#>Brandywine Valley SPCA</a>, a no-kill animal shelter in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5GZerPBy56qZpmcqrpurtGimKdlnJa7pK3SrZyrZZSarqV5wK1kbWtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
