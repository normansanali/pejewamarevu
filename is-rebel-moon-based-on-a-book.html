Recommended Videos The super short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is “no, but calling it an original concept isn’t exactly honest, either.” The even longer answer than that is “It’s an amalgamation of a bunch of other people’s ideas, thinly coated in Zack Snyder-brand varnish and presumably run past a bunch of intellectual property experts to make super, duper sure that none of this is actionable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unfortunately for Snyder, talks with Lucasfilm fell apart when the company was purchased, Kitt Fisto and Kaboodle Fisto, by the good folks at Disney. Disney’s higher-ups didn’t cotton to Snyder’s ideas, and a&nbsp;Heavy Metal, Magazine-inspired Jedi epic was left forever unrealized, leaving ample space for memorable entries to the franchise like&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;and that show about Obi-Wan being sad.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>All of that being said, after a long process of shopping the project around as a movie, TV show, and video game, Rebel Moon remained, down to its DNA, a Star Wars movie. It’s not ashamed to say it, either: This is a heavily inspired homage to the sci-fi throwbacks from the ‘70s and ‘80s. It just has more swearing and, in all likelihood, a fully exposed butt.</p><p data-characters=1135 data-current-count=1135 data-injectable=false>Tangentially, of course,&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is based on a few books. If&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is based on&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;and&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;is based on every book that Joseph Campbell ever wrote about, then&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is just another of a thousand faces hanging from an enigmatic hero. Shots from&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;look treacherously similar to Snyder’s previous work,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">300</a>,&nbsp;which takes direct page-to-screen visual inspiration from the comic book of the same name. Most importantly,&nbsp;Rebel Moon&nbsp;is, inescapably, a Zack Snyder project. Zack Snyder’s projects are, to a one, sopping with references to&nbsp;Excalibur,&nbsp;the adult-leaning 1981 King Arthur adaptation with blood and guts that Snyder has called “the perfect meeting of movies and mythology.” With studied dedication, he has aped&nbsp;Excalibur&nbsp;and, by extension, the writings of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the King Arthur mythos</a>&nbsp;in all of his work, and it would be genuinely bananas if it didn’t show up in his latest story. Mark my words: Carla Gugino will reprise her role from&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;as “Computer just flat out quoting&nbsp;Excalibur&nbsp;lines for a while.” I may be getting frustrated with Zack Snyder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlopqvpriMpqaopl2XrrSxw2amp2WRYq%2Bwu8po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
