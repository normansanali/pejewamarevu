Because the Amber Heard that I knew for the first year, year and a half was not this, suddenly this opponent,” he explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year after their wedding, Amber filed for divorce and sought a restraining order against Johnny, accusing him of verbal and physical abuse. The <a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean</a> actor denied the claims, and their divorce was granted in 2017.</p><p>The following year, Amber wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in which she described the abuse she alleges to have faced in their marriage. In response, Johnny sued her for defamation in early 2019 and again denied her claims.</p><p>Amber was quick to file a countersuit, claiming that her ex-husband was responsible for harassment she faced online that attempted to get her fired from projects, including Aquaman and a campaign for L’Oréal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his opening statements, Johnny explained he was compelled to launch the $50 million lawsuit in order to clear the air and establish “the truth.” "Since I knew there was no truth to it whatsoever, I felt it my responsibility to stand up not only for myself in that instance but stand up for my children, who at the time were 14 and 16,” the actor told the court.</p><p>Amber hasn’t taken the stand yet but is expected to next week. Her legal team claims they plan to expose Johnny’s multiple forms of abuse, which they argue includes sexual assault.</p><p>This isn’t the first lawsuit Johnny has launched over his ex-wife’s allegations. He also sued The Sun for referring to him as a “wife beater.” However, he lost the case in 2020 as well as his attempt to overturn the decision the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeo8ZusMSpp2aqlauyorjSZq6hsV2htq3FjKumrJ1dmbKxvIysoqKooJqxbsPEnZuippdirq6uxKtkoZ2Rp7Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
