However, it was later revealed that the school had no real campus and operated as a scam. The team gained attention after scheduling a football game against the No. 2 team in the country. The blowout loss to IMG Academy, televised on ESPN, triggered increased scrutiny and investigation into the school's legitimacy.</p></li><li readability=4><p>Unveiling the Scam: Investigations uncovered that Bishop Sycamore had recruited student-athletes who were older than high-school age and lacked proper academic and athletic facilities. Athletes were housed in a hotel and received minimal schooling, raising concerns about their education and overall well-being. Former players disclosed that they had been recruited under false promises, including practicing at Ohio State's facilities.</p></li><li readability=8><p>A Web of Deception: Bishop Sycamore's origins traced back to a start-up football school called Christians of Faith Academy. Both institutions were connected through some of the same individuals. Christians of Faith Academy had also faced scrutiny in the past due to questionable circumstances surrounding its establishment.

However, the school's head coach, Roy Johnson, was fired amidst the scandal.</p></li><li readability=3><p>Legal Issues and Lack of Credibility: The scandal surrounding Bishop Sycamore had far-reaching consequences. The school faced legal issues and lacked the necessary infrastructure to maintain coaches and athletic trainers. Several teams scheduled to play against Bishop Sycamore withdrew from their games, citing concerns over the school's credibility. Accusations that the school stiffed a hotel it stayed in for a nationally televised game further tarnished its reputation.</p></li><li readability=2><p>Fallout and Calls for Investigation: The Bishop Sycamore scandal prompted Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to call for a thorough investigation into the school's operations. The incident raised questions about the oversight and regulation of non-traditional educational institutions. It also highlighted the need for stronger safeguards to protect student-athletes from exploitation and fraudulent practices.</p></li><p>The Bishop Sycamore scandal serves as a cautionary tale, exposing the dark underbelly of an operation that deceived the public and exploited young athletes. It reveals the urgent need for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
